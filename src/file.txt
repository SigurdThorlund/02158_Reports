Book 01        Genesis

01:001:001 In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.

01:001:002 And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was
           upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon
           the face of the waters.

01:001:003 And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.

01:001:004 And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the
           light from the darkness.

01:001:005 And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called
           Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.

01:001:006 And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the
           waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.

01:001:007 And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were
           under the firmament from the waters which were above the
           firmament: and it was so.

01:001:008 And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the
           morning were the second day.

01:001:009 And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered
           together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it
           was so.

01:001:010 And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together
           of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.

01:001:011 And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb
           yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his
           kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.

01:001:012 And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed
           after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in
           itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.

01:001:013 And the evening and the morning were the third day.

01:001:014 And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the
           heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for
           signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:

01:001:015 And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to
           give light upon the earth: and it was so.

01:001:016 And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the
           day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars
           also.

01:001:017 And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light
           upon the earth,

01:001:018 And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the
           light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.

01:001:019 And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.

01:001:020 And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving
           creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth
           in the open firmament of heaven.

01:001:021 And God created great whales, and every living creature that
           moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their
           kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that
           it was good.

01:001:022 And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and
           fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the
           earth.

01:001:023 And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.

01:001:024 And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature
           after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the
           earth after his kind: and it was so.

01:001:025 And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle
           after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth
           after his kind: and God saw that it was good.

01:001:026 And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our
           likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea,
           and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over
           all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth
           upon the earth.

01:001:027 So God created man in his own image, in the image of God
           created he him; male and female created he them.

01:001:028 And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and
           multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have
           dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the
           air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.

01:001:029 And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing
           seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree,
           in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it
           shall be for meat.

01:001:030 And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air,
           and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there
           is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was
           so.

01:001:031 And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was
           very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.

01:002:001 Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host
           of them.

01:002:002 And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made;
           and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he
           had made.

01:002:003 And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because
           that in it he had rested from all his work which God created
           and made.

01:002:004 These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when
           they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth
           and the heavens,

01:002:005 And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and
           every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had
           not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man
           to till the ground.

01:002:006 But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole
           face of the ground.

01:002:007 And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and
           breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became
           a living soul.

01:002:008 And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there
           he put the man whom he had formed.

01:002:009 And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree
           that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of
           life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of
           knowledge of good and evil.

01:002:010 And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from
           thence it was parted, and became into four heads.

01:002:011 The name of the first is Pison: that is it which compasseth
           the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;

01:002:012 And the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the
           onyx stone.

01:002:013 And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that
           compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia.

01:002:014 And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which
           goeth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is
           Euphrates.

01:002:015 And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of
           Eden to dress it and to keep it.

01:002:016 And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of
           the garden thou mayest freely eat:

01:002:017 But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt
           not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou
           shalt surely die.

01:002:018 And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be
           alone; I will make him an help meet for him.

01:002:019 And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the
           field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam
           to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called
           every living creature, that was the name thereof.

01:002:020 And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air,
           and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not
           found an help meet for him.

01:002:021 And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he
           slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh
           instead thereof;

01:002:022 And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a
           woman, and brought her unto the man.

01:002:023 And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my
           flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of
           Man.

01:002:024 Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and
           shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.

01:002:025 And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not
           ashamed.

01:003:001 Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field
           which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea,
           hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?

01:003:002 And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit
           of the trees of the garden:

01:003:003 But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the
           garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall
           ye touch it, lest ye die.

01:003:004 And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:

01:003:005 For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your
           eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good
           and evil.

01:003:006 And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and
           that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to
           make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and
           gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.

01:003:007 And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they
           were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made
           themselves aprons.

01:003:008 And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden
           in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves
           from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the
           garden.

01:003:009 And the LORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where
           art thou?

01:003:010 And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was
           afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.

01:003:011 And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou
           eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou
           shouldest not eat?

01:003:012 And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me,
           she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.

01:003:013 And the LORD God said unto the woman, What is this that thou
           hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I
           did eat.

01:003:014 And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done
           this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast
           of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt
           thou eat all the days of thy life:

01:003:015 And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between
           thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou
           shalt bruise his heel.

01:003:016 Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and
           thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and
           thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over
           thee.

01:003:017 And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the
           voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I
           commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is
           the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all
           the days of thy life;

01:003:018 Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and
           thou shalt eat the herb of the field;

01:003:019 In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou
           return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for
           dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.

01:003:020 And Adam called his wife's name Eve; because she was the
           mother of all living.

01:003:021 Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of
           skins, and clothed them.

01:003:022 And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us,
           to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand,
           and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:

01:003:023 Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden,
           to till the ground from whence he was taken.

01:003:024 So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the
           garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned
           every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.

01:004:001 And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain,
           and said, I have gotten a man from the LORD.

01:004:002 And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of
           sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.

01:004:003 And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of
           the fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD.

01:004:004 And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and
           of the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to
           his offering:

01:004:005 But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain
           was very wroth, and his countenance fell.

01:004:006 And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is
           thy countenance fallen?

01:004:007 If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou
           doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee shall be
           his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.

01:004:008 And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass,
           when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel
           his brother, and slew him.

01:004:009 And the LORD said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he
           said, I know not: Am I my brother's keeper?

01:004:010 And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's
           blood crieth unto me from the ground.

01:004:011 And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her
           mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand;

01:004:012 When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield
           unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou
           be in the earth.

01:004:013 And Cain said unto the LORD, My punishment is greater than I
           can bear.

01:004:014 Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the
           earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a
           fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to
           pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me.

01:004:015 And the LORD said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain,
           vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the LORD set a
           mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him.

01:004:016 And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in
           the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.

01:004:017 And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and
           he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the
           name of his son, Enoch.

01:004:018 And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and
           Mehujael begat Methusael: and Methusael begat Lamech.

01:004:019 And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was
           Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.

01:004:020 And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in
           tents, and of such as have cattle.

01:004:021 And his brother's name was Jubal: he was the father of all
           such as handle the harp and organ.

01:004:022 And Zillah, she also bare Tubalcain, an instructor of every
           artificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubalcain was
           Naamah.

01:004:023 And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my
           voice; ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: for I have
           slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt.

01:004:024 If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and
           sevenfold.

01:004:025 And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called
           his name Seth: For God, said she, hath appointed me another
           seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew.

01:004:026 And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called
           his name Enos: then began men to call upon the name of the
           LORD.

01:005:001 This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that
           God created man, in the likeness of God made he him;

01:005:002 Male and female created he them; and blessed them, and called
           their name Adam, in the day when they were created.

01:005:003 And Adam lived an hundred and thirty years, and begat a son in
           his own likeness, and after his image; and called his name
           Seth:

01:005:004 And the days of Adam after he had begotten Seth were eight
           hundred years: and he begat sons and daughters:

01:005:005 And all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty
           years: and he died.

01:005:006 And Seth lived an hundred and five years, and begat Enos:

01:005:007 And Seth lived after he begat Enos eight hundred and seven
           years, and begat sons and daughters:

01:005:008 And all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years:
           and he died.

01:005:009 And Enos lived ninety years, and begat Cainan:

01:005:010 And Enos lived after he begat Cainan eight hundred and fifteen
           years, and begat sons and daughters:

01:005:011 And all the days of Enos were nine hundred and five years: and
           he died.

01:005:012 And Cainan lived seventy years and begat Mahalaleel:

01:005:013 And Cainan lived after he begat Mahalaleel eight hundred and
           forty years, and begat sons and daughters:

01:005:014 And all the days of Cainan were nine hundred and ten years:
           and he died.

01:005:015 And Mahalaleel lived sixty and five years, and begat Jared:

01:005:016 And Mahalaleel lived after he begat Jared eight hundred and
           thirty years, and begat sons and daughters:

01:005:017 And all the days of Mahalaleel were eight hundred ninety and
           five years: and he died.

01:005:018 And Jared lived an hundred sixty and two years, and he begat
           Enoch:

01:005:019 And Jared lived after he begat Enoch eight hundred years, and
           begat sons and daughters:

01:005:020 And all the days of Jared were nine hundred sixty and two
           years: and he died.

01:005:021 And Enoch lived sixty and five years, and begat Methuselah:

01:005:022 And Enoch walked with God after he begat Methuselah three
           hundred years, and begat sons and daughters:

01:005:023 And all the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty and five
           years:

01:005:024 And Enoch walked with God: and he was not; for God took him.

01:005:025 And Methuselah lived an hundred eighty and seven years, and
           begat Lamech.

01:005:026 And Methuselah lived after he begat Lamech seven hundred
           eighty and two years, and begat sons and daughters:

01:005:027 And all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred sixty and
           nine years: and he died.

01:005:028 And Lamech lived an hundred eighty and two years, and begat a
           son:

01:005:029 And he called his name Noah, saying, This same shall comfort
           us concerning our work and toil of our hands, because of the
           ground which the LORD hath cursed.

01:005:030 And Lamech lived after he begat Noah five hundred ninety and
           five years, and begat sons and daughters:

01:005:031 And all the days of Lamech were seven hundred seventy and
           seven years: and he died.

01:005:032 And Noah was five hundred years old: and Noah begat Shem, Ham,
           and Japheth.

01:006:001 And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of
           the earth, and daughters were born unto them,

01:006:002 That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were
           fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.

01:006:003 And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man,
           for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred
           and twenty years.

01:006:004 There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after
           that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men,
           and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men
           which were of old, men of renown.

01:006:005 And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth,
           and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was
           only evil continually.

01:006:006 And it repented the LORD that he had made man on the earth,
           and it grieved him at his heart.

01:006:007 And the LORD said, I will destroy man whom I have created from
           the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping
           thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I
           have made them.

01:006:008 But Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD.

01:006:009 These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and
           perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God.

01:006:010 And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.

01:006:011 The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was
           filled with violence.

01:006:012 And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt;
           for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.

01:006:013 And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before
           me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and,
           behold, I will destroy them with the earth.

01:006:014 Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the
           ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.

01:006:015 And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The
           length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth
           of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.

01:006:016 A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou
           finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the
           side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou
           make it.

01:006:017 And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the
           earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life,
           from under heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall
           die.

01:006:018 But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt
           come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy
           sons' wives with thee.

01:006:019 And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort
           shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee;
           they shall be male and female.

01:006:020 Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of
           every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every
           sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive.

01:006:021 And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou
           shalt gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee,
           and for them.

01:006:022 Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did
           he.

01:007:001 And the LORD said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy house into
           the ark; for thee have I seen righteous before me in this
           generation.

01:007:002 Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the
           male and his female: and of beasts that are not clean by two,
           the male and his female.

01:007:003 Of fowls also of the air by sevens, the male and the female;
           to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth.

01:007:004 For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth
           forty days and forty nights; and every living substance that I
           have made will I destroy from off the face of the earth.

01:007:005 And Noah did according unto all that the LORD commanded him.

01:007:006 And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters
           was upon the earth.

01:007:007 And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons'
           wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the
           flood.

01:007:008 Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of
           fowls, and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth,

01:007:009 There went in two and two unto Noah into the ark, the male and
           the female, as God had commanded Noah.

01:007:010 And it came to pass after seven days, that the waters of the
           flood were upon the earth.

01:007:011 In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month,
           the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the
           fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of
           heaven were opened.

01:007:012 And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights.

01:007:013 In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and
           Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three
           wives of his sons with them, into the ark;

01:007:014 They, and every beast after his kind, and all the cattle after
           their kind, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the
           earth after his kind, and every fowl after his kind, every
           bird of every sort.

01:007:015 And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all
           flesh, wherein is the breath of life.

01:007:016 And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh,
           as God had commanded him: and the LORD shut him in.

01:007:017 And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters
           increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the
           earth.

01:007:018 And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the
           earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.

01:007:019 And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all
           the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were
           covered.

01:007:020 Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the
           mountains were covered.

01:007:021 And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl,
           and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that
           creepeth upon the earth, and every man:

01:007:022 All in whose nostrils was the breath of life, of all that was
           in the dry land, died.

01:007:023 And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the
           face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping
           things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed
           from the earth: and Noah only remained alive, and they that
           were with him in the ark.

01:007:024 And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty
           days.

01:008:001 And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the
           cattle that was with him in the ark: and God made a wind to
           pass over the earth, and the waters asswaged;

01:008:002 The fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were
           stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained;

01:008:003 And the waters returned from off the earth continually: and
           after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were
           abated.

01:008:004 And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth
           day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat.

01:008:005 And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in
           the tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops
           of the mountains seen.

01:008:006 And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened
           the window of the ark which he had made:

01:008:007 And he sent forth a raven, which went forth to and fro, until
           the waters were dried up from off the earth.

01:008:008 Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were
           abated from off the face of the ground;

01:008:009 But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she
           returned unto him into the ark, for the waters were on the
           face of the whole earth: then he put forth his hand, and took
           her, and pulled her in unto him into the ark.

01:008:010 And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth
           the dove out of the ark;

01:008:011 And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her
           mouth was an olive leaf pluckt off: so Noah knew that the
           waters were abated from off the earth.

01:008:012 And he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove;
           which returned not again unto him any more.

01:008:013 And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in
           the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were
           dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of
           the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was
           dry.

01:008:014 And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the
           month, was the earth dried.

01:008:015 And God spake unto Noah, saying,

01:008:016 Go forth of the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy
           sons' wives with thee.

01:008:017 Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of
           all flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping
           thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed
           abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon
           the earth.

01:008:018 And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons'
           wives with him:

01:008:019 Every beast, every creeping thing, and every fowl, and
           whatsoever creepeth upon the earth, after their kinds, went
           forth out of the ark.

01:008:020 And Noah builded an altar unto the LORD; and took of every
           clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt
           offerings on the altar.

01:008:021 And the LORD smelled a sweet savour; and the LORD said in his
           heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man's
           sake; for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his
           youth; neither will I again smite any more every thing living,
           as I have done.

01:008:022 While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and
           heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not
           cease.

01:009:001 And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be
           fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.

01:009:002 And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every
           beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all
           that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the
           sea; into your hand are they delivered.

01:009:003 Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as
           the green herb have I given you all things.

01:009:004 But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof,
           shall ye not eat.

01:009:005 And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the
           hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man;
           at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of
           man.

01:009:006 Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed:
           for in the image of God made he man.

01:009:007 And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly
           in the earth, and multiply therein.

01:009:008 And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying,

01:009:009 And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your
           seed after you;

01:009:010 And with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl,
           of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from
           all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.

01:009:011 And I will establish my covenant with you, neither shall all
           flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither
           shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.

01:009:012 And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make
           between me and you and every living creature that is with you,
           for perpetual generations:

01:009:013 I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a
           covenant between me and the earth.

01:009:014 And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the
           earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud:

01:009:015 And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you
           and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall
           no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.

01:009:016 And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it,
           that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and
           every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.

01:009:017 And God said unto Noah, This is the token of the covenant,
           which I have established between me and all flesh that is upon
           the earth.

01:009:018 And the sons of Noah, that went forth of the ark, were Shem,
           and Ham, and Japheth: and Ham is the father of Canaan.

01:009:019 These are the three sons of Noah: and of them was the whole
           earth overspread.

01:009:020 And Noah began to be an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard:

01:009:021 And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was
           uncovered within his tent.

01:009:022 And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his
           father, and told his two brethren without.

01:009:023 And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both
           their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness
           of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw
           not their father's nakedness.

01:009:024 And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son
           had done unto him.

01:009:025 And he said, Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he
           be unto his brethren.

01:009:026 And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Shem; and Canaan shall
           be his servant.

01:009:027 God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of
           Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.

01:009:028 And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.

01:009:029 And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years:
           and he died.

01:010:001 Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham,
           and Japheth: and unto them were sons born after the flood.

01:010:002 The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan,
           and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras.

01:010:003 And the sons of Gomer; Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah.

01:010:004 And the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and
           Dodanim.

01:010:005 By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their
           lands; every one after his tongue, after their families, in
           their nations.

01:010:006 And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan.

01:010:007 And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and
           Raamah, and Sabtechah: and the sons of Raamah; Sheba, and
           Dedan.

01:010:008 And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the
           earth.

01:010:009 He was a mighty hunter before the LORD: wherefore it is said,
           Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the LORD.

01:010:010 And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and
           Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.

01:010:011 Out of that land went forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh, and
           the city Rehoboth, and Calah,

01:010:012 And Resen between Nineveh and Calah: the same is a great city.

01:010:013 And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and
           Naphtuhim,

01:010:014 And Pathrusim, and Casluhim, (out of whom came Philistim,) and
           Caphtorim.

01:010:015 And Canaan begat Sidon his first born, and Heth,

01:010:016 And the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgasite,

01:010:017 And the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite,

01:010:018 And the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite: and
           afterward were the families of the Canaanites spread abroad.

01:010:019 And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou
           comest to Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest, unto Sodom, and
           Gomorrah, and Admah, and Zeboim, even unto Lasha.

01:010:020 These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their
           tongues, in their countries, and in their nations.

01:010:021 Unto Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, the
           brother of Japheth the elder, even to him were children born.

01:010:022 The children of Shem; Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud,
           and Aram.

01:010:023 And the children of Aram; Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash.

01:010:024 And Arphaxad begat Salah; and Salah begat Eber.

01:010:025 And unto Eber were born two sons: the name of one was Peleg;
           for in his days was the earth divided; and his brother's name
           was Joktan.

01:010:026 And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and
           Jerah,

01:010:027 And Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah,

01:010:028 And Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba,

01:010:029 And Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: all these were the sons of
           Joktan.

01:010:030 And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest unto Sephar a
           mount of the east.

01:010:031 These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their
           tongues, in their lands, after their nations.

01:010:032 These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their
           generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations
           divided in the earth after the flood.

01:011:001 And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech.

01:011:002 And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that
           they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt
           there.

01:011:003 And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and
           burn them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime
           had they for morter.

01:011:004 And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower,
           whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name,
           lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.

01:011:005 And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which
           the children of men builded.

01:011:006 And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and they have
           all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing
           will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do.

01:011:007 Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that
           they may not understand one another's speech.

01:011:008 So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of
           all the earth: and they left off to build the city.

01:011:009 Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the LORD did
           there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence
           did the LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the
           earth.

01:011:010 These are the generations of Shem: Shem was an hundred years
           old, and begat Arphaxad two years after the flood:

01:011:011 And Shem lived after he begat Arphaxad five hundred years, and
           begat sons and daughters.

01:011:012 And Arphaxad lived five and thirty years, and begat Salah:

01:011:013 And Arphaxad lived after he begat Salah four hundred and three
           years, and begat sons and daughters.

01:011:014 And Salah lived thirty years, and begat Eber:

01:011:015 And Salah lived after he begat Eber four hundred and three
           years, and begat sons and daughters.

01:011:016 And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg:

01:011:017 And Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty
           years, and begat sons and daughters.

01:011:018 And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu:

01:011:019 And Peleg lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years,
           and begat sons and daughters.

01:011:020 And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug:

01:011:021 And Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven
           years, and begat sons and daughters.

01:011:022 And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor:

01:011:023 And Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and
           begat sons and daughters.

01:011:024 And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah:

01:011:025 And Nahor lived after he begat Terah an hundred and nineteen
           years, and begat sons and daughters.

01:011:026 And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and
           Haran.

01:011:027 Now these are the generations of Terah: Terah begat Abram,
           Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begat Lot.

01:011:028 And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his
           nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees.

01:011:029 And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram's wife
           was Sarai; and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, the daughter
           of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah.

01:011:030 But Sarai was barren; she had no child.

01:011:031 And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his
           son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's
           wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees,
           to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and
           dwelt there.

01:011:032 And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and
           Terah died in Haran.

01:012:001 Now the LORD had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country,
           and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land
           that I will shew thee:

01:012:002 And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee,
           and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:

01:012:003 And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that
           curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be
           blessed.

01:012:004 So Abram departed, as the LORD had spoken unto him; and Lot
           went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when
           he departed out of Haran.

01:012:005 And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and
           all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that
           they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the
           land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.

01:012:006 And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Sichem,
           unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the
           land.

01:012:007 And the LORD appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will
           I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the LORD,
           who appeared unto him.

01:012:008 And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of
           Bethel, and pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and
           Hai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the LORD,
           and called upon the name of the LORD.

01:012:009 And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south.

01:012:010 And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into
           Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the
           land.

01:012:011 And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into
           Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know
           that thou art a fair woman to look upon:

01:012:012 Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see
           thee, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will
           kill me, but they will save thee alive.

01:012:013 Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with
           me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.

01:012:014 And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the
           Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.

01:012:015 The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before
           Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.

01:012:016 And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep,
           and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and
           she asses, and camels.

01:012:017 And the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues
           because of Sarai Abram's wife.

01:012:018 And Pharaoh called Abram and said, What is this that thou hast
           done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy
           wife?

01:012:019 Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her
           to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go
           thy way.

01:012:020 And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent
           him away, and his wife, and all that he had.

01:013:001 And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that
           he had, and Lot with him, into the south.

01:013:002 And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.

01:013:003 And he went on his journeys from the south even to Bethel,
           unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning,
           between Bethel and Hai;

01:013:004 Unto the place of the altar, which he had make there at the
           first: and there Abram called on the name of the LORD.

01:013:005 And Lot also, which went with Abram, had flocks, and herds,
           and tents.

01:013:006 And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell
           together: for their substance was great, so that they could
           not dwell together.

01:013:007 And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram's cattle
           and the herdmen of Lot's cattle: and the Canaanite and the
           Perizzite dwelled then in the land.

01:013:008 And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee,
           between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen;
           for we be brethren.

01:013:009 Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray
           thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go
           to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will
           go to the left.

01:013:010 And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of
           Jordan, that it was well watered every where, before the LORD
           destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, even as the garden of the LORD,
           like the land of Egypt, as thou comest unto Zoar.

01:013:011 Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed
           east: and they separated themselves the one from the other.

01:013:012 Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the
           cities of the plain, and pitched his tent toward Sodom.

01:013:013 But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the LORD
           exceedingly.

01:013:014 And the LORD said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated
           from him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place
           where thou art northward, and southward, and eastward, and
           westward:

01:013:015 For all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and
           to thy seed for ever.

01:013:016 And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if
           a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed
           also be numbered.

01:013:017 Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the
           breadth of it; for I will give it unto thee.

01:013:018 Then Abram removed his tent, and came and dwelt in the plain
           of Mamre, which is in Hebron, and built there an altar unto
           the LORD.

01:014:001 And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar,
           Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal
           king of nations;

01:014:002 That these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha
           king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of
           Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar.

01:014:003 All these were joined together in the vale of Siddim, which is
           the salt sea.

01:014:004 Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth
           year they rebelled.

01:014:005 And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings
           that were with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth
           Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emins in Shaveh
           Kiriathaim,

01:014:006 And the Horites in their mount Seir, unto Elparan, which is by
           the wilderness.

01:014:007 And they returned, and came to Enmishpat, which is Kadesh, and
           smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the
           Amorites, that dwelt in Hazezontamar.

01:014:008 And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of
           Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and
           the king of Bela (the same is Zoar;) and they joined battle
           with them in the vale of Siddim;

01:014:009 With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of
           nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of
           Ellasar; four kings with five.

01:014:010 And the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits; and the kings of
           Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that
           remained fled to the mountain.

01:014:011 And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all
           their victuals, and went their way.

01:014:012 And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom,
           and his goods, and departed.

01:014:013 And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the
           Hebrew; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite,
           brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these were
           confederate with Abram.

01:014:014 And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he
           armed his trained servants, born in his own house, three
           hundred and eighteen, and pursued them unto Dan.

01:014:015 And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by
           night, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is
           on the left hand of Damascus.

01:014:016 And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his
           brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the
           people.

01:014:017 And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return
           from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were
           with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which is the king's dale.

01:014:018 And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine:
           and he was the priest of the most high God.

01:014:019 And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most
           high God, possessor of heaven and earth:

01:014:020 And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine
           enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.

01:014:021 And the king of Sodom said unto Abram, Give me the persons,
           and take the goods to thyself.

01:014:022 And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand
           unto the LORD, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and
           earth,

01:014:023 That I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and
           that I will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou
           shouldest say, I have made Abram rich:

01:014:024 Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion
           of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let
           them take their portion.

01:015:001 After these things the word of the LORD came unto Abram in a
           vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy
           exceeding great reward.

01:015:002 And Abram said, LORD God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go
           childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of
           Damascus?

01:015:003 And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and,
           lo, one born in my house is mine heir.

01:015:004 And, behold, the word of the LORD came unto him, saying, This
           shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of
           thine own bowels shall be thine heir.

01:015:005 And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward
           heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them:
           and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be.

01:015:006 And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for
           righteousness.

01:015:007 And he said unto him, I am the LORD that brought thee out of
           Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it.

01:015:008 And he said, LORD God, whereby shall I know that I shall
           inherit it?

01:015:009 And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old,
           and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years
           old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.

01:015:010 And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst,
           and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided
           he not.

01:015:011 And when the fowls came down upon the carcases, Abram drove
           them away.

01:015:012 And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram;
           and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.

01:015:013 And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall
           be a stranger in a land that is not their's, and shall serve
           them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;

01:015:014 And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and
           afterward shall they come out with great substance.

01:015:015 And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be
           buried in a good old age.

01:015:016 But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for
           the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.

01:015:017 And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was
           dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed
           between those pieces.

01:015:018 In the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying,
           Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt
           unto the great river, the river Euphrates:

01:015:019 The Kenites, and the Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites,

01:015:020 And the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Rephaims,

01:015:021 And the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Girgashites, and
           the Jebusites.

01:016:001 Now Sarai Abram's wife bare him no children: and she had an
           handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar.

01:016:002 And Sarai said unto Abram, Behold now, the LORD hath
           restrained me from bearing: I pray thee, go in unto my maid;
           it may be that I may obtain children by her. And Abram
           hearkened to the voice of Sarai.

01:016:003 And Sarai Abram's wife took Hagar her maid the Egyptian, after
           Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her
           to her husband Abram to be his wife.

01:016:004 And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw
           that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.

01:016:005 And Sarai said unto Abram, My wrong be upon thee: I have given
           my maid into thy bosom; and when she saw that she had
           conceived, I was despised in her eyes: the LORD judge between
           me and thee.

01:016:006 But Abram said unto Sarai, Behold, thy maid is in thine hand;
           do to her as it pleaseth thee. And when Sarai dealt hardly
           with her, she fled from her face.

01:016:007 And the angel of the LORD found her by a fountain of water in
           the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur.

01:016:008 And he said, Hagar, Sarai's maid, whence camest thou? and
           whither wilt thou go? And she said, I flee from the face of my
           mistress Sarai.

01:016:009 And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Return to thy
           mistress, and submit thyself under her hands.

01:016:010 And the angel of the LORD said unto her, I will multiply thy
           seed exceedingly, that it shall not be numbered for multitude.

01:016:011 And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Behold, thou art with
           child and shalt bear a son, and shalt call his name Ishmael;
           because the LORD hath heard thy affliction.

01:016:012 And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man,
           and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the
           presence of all his brethren.

01:016:013 And she called the name of the LORD that spake unto her, Thou
           God seest me: for she said, Have I also here looked after him
           that seeth me?

01:016:014 Wherefore the well was called Beerlahairoi; behold, it is
           between Kadesh and Bered.

01:016:015 And Hagar bare Abram a son: and Abram called his son's name,
           which Hagar bare, Ishmael.

01:016:016 And Abram was fourscore and six years old, when Hagar bare
           Ishmael to Abram.

01:017:001 And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the LORD
           appeared to Abram, and said unto him, I am the Almighty God;
           walk before me, and be thou perfect.

01:017:002 And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will
           multiply thee exceedingly.

01:017:003 And Abram fell on his face: and God talked with him, saying,

01:017:004 As for me, behold, my covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be
           a father of many nations.

01:017:005 Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name
           shall be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made
           thee.

01:017:006 And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make
           nations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee.

01:017:007 And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy
           seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting
           covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.

01:017:008 And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the
           land wherein thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for
           an everlasting possession; and I will be their God.

01:017:009 And God said unto Abraham, Thou shalt keep my covenant
           therefore, thou, and thy seed after thee in their generations.

01:017:010 This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you
           and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be
           circumcised.

01:017:011 And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and it
           shall be a token of the covenant betwixt me and you.

01:017:012 And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you,
           every man child in your generations, he that is born in the
           house, or bought with money of any stranger, which is not of
           thy seed.

01:017:013 He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy
           money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in
           your flesh for an everlasting covenant.

01:017:014 And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is
           not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people;
           he hath broken my covenant.

01:017:015 And God said unto Abraham, As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt
           not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall her name be.

01:017:016 And I will bless her, and give thee a son also of her: yea, I
           will bless her, and she shall be a mother of nations; kings of
           people shall be of her.

01:017:017 Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his
           heart, Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years
           old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?

01:017:018 And Abraham said unto God, O that Ishmael might live before
           thee!

01:017:019 And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and
           thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my
           covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, and with his
           seed after him.

01:017:020 And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed
           him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him
           exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make
           him a great nation.

01:017:021 But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, which Sarah shall
           bear unto thee at this set time in the next year.

01:017:022 And he left off talking with him, and God went up from
           Abraham.

01:017:023 And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in
           his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male
           among the men of Abraham's house; and circumcised the flesh of
           their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said unto him.

01:017:024 And Abraham was ninety years old and nine, when he was
           circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.

01:017:025 And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old, when he was
           circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.

01:017:026 In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his
           son.

01:017:027 And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought
           with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him.

01:018:001 And the LORD appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre: and he
           sat in the tent door in the heat of the day;

01:018:002 And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood
           by him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the
           tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,

01:018:003 And said, My LORD, if now I have found favour in thy sight,
           pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant:

01:018:004 Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your
           feet, and rest yourselves under the tree:

01:018:005 And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your
           hearts; after that ye shall pass on: for therefore are ye come
           to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said.

01:018:006 And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make
           ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make
           cakes upon the hearth.

01:018:007 And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht a calf tender and
           good, and gave it unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it.

01:018:008 And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had
           dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under
           the tree, and they did eat.

01:018:009 And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said,
           Behold, in the tent.

01:018:010 And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to
           the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son.
           And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him.

01:018:011 Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age; and
           it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.

01:018:012 Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am
           waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?

01:018:013 And the LORD said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh,
           saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am old?

01:018:014 Is any thing too hard for the LORD? At the time appointed I
           will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and
           Sarah shall have a son.

01:018:015 Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid.
           And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.

01:018:016 And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and
           Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.

01:018:017 And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which
           I do;

01:018:018 Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty
           nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in
           him?

01:018:019 For I know him, that he will command his children and his
           household after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD,
           to do justice and judgment; that the LORD may bring upon
           Abraham that which he hath spoken of him.

01:018:020 And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is
           great, and because their sin is very grievous;

01:018:021 I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether
           according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not,
           I will know.

01:018:022 And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward
           Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the LORD.

01:018:023 And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the
           righteous with the wicked?

01:018:024 Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt
           thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty
           righteous that are therein?

01:018:025 That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the
           righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as
           the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all
           the earth do right?

01:018:026 And the LORD said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within
           the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes.

01:018:027 And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon
           me to speak unto the LORD, which am but dust and ashes:

01:018:028 Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous:
           wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said,
           If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy it.

01:018:029 And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there
           shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for
           forty's sake.

01:018:030 And he said unto him, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will
           speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he
           said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there.

01:018:031 And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto
           the LORD: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And
           he said, I will not destroy it for twenty's sake.

01:018:032 And he said, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will speak
           yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And
           he said, I will not destroy it for ten's sake.

01:018:033 And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had left communing
           with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place.

01:019:001 And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the
           gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and
           he bowed himself with his face toward the ground;

01:019:002 And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into
           your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet,
           and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they
           said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.

01:019:003 And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him,
           and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did
           bake unleavened bread, and they did eat.

01:019:004 But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of
           Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the
           people from every quarter:

01:019:005 And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men
           which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that
           we may know them.

01:019:006 And Lot went out at the door unto them, and shut the door
           after him,

01:019:007 And said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly.

01:019:008 Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let
           me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as
           is good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for
           therefore came they under the shadow of my roof.

01:019:009 And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one
           fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now
           will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed
           sore upon the man, even Lot, and came near to break the door.

01:019:010 But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the
           house to them, and shut to the door.

01:019:011 And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with
           blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied
           themselves to find the door.

01:019:012 And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in
           law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast
           in the city, bring them out of this place:

01:019:013 For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is
           waxen great before the face of the LORD; and the LORD hath
           sent us to destroy it.

01:019:014 And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which
           married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this
           place; for the LORD will destroy this city. But he seemed as
           one that mocked unto his sons in law.

01:019:015 And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot,
           saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are
           here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.

01:019:016 And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and
           upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two
           daughters; the LORD being merciful unto him: and they brought
           him forth, and set him without the city.

01:019:017 And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad,
           that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee,
           neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain,
           lest thou be consumed.

01:019:018 And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my LORD:

01:019:019 Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and
           thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me
           in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest
           some evil take me, and I die:

01:019:020 Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little
           one: Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and
           my soul shall live.

01:019:021 And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning
           this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the
           which thou hast spoken.

01:019:022 Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do anything till thou
           be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called
           Zoar.

01:019:023 The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar.

01:019:024 Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone
           and fire from the LORD out of heaven;

01:019:025 And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the
           inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the
           ground.

01:019:026 But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a
           pillar of salt.

01:019:027 And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he
           stood before the LORD:

01:019:028 And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the
           land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the
           country went up as the smoke of a furnace.

01:019:029 And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the
           plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the
           midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the
           which Lot dwelt.

01:019:030 And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and
           his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar:
           and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.

01:019:031 And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old,
           and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after
           the manner of all the earth:

01:019:032 Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with
           him, that we may preserve seed of our father.

01:019:033 And they made their father drink wine that night: and the
           firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived
           not when she lay down, nor when she arose.

01:019:034 And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said
           unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father:
           let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in,
           and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.

01:019:035 And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the
           younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she
           lay down, nor when she arose.

01:019:036 Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their
           father.

01:019:037 And the first born bare a son, and called his name Moab: the
           same is the father of the Moabites unto this day.

01:019:038 And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name
           Benammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto
           this day.

01:020:001 And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country,
           and dwelled between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar.

01:020:002 And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister: and
           Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah.

01:020:003 But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to
           him, Behold, thou art but a dead man, for the woman which thou
           hast taken; for she is a man's wife.

01:020:004 But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, LORD, wilt
           thou slay also a righteous nation?

01:020:005 Said he not unto me, She is my sister? and she, even she
           herself said, He is my brother: in the integrity of my heart
           and innocency of my hands have I done this.

01:020:006 And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst
           this in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee
           from sinning against me: therefore suffered I thee not to
           touch her.

01:020:007 Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet,
           and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou
           restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou,
           and all that are thine.

01:020:008 Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all
           his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the
           men were sore afraid.

01:020:009 Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast
           thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou
           hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast
           done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.

01:020:010 And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou
           hast done this thing?

01:020:011 And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God is
           not in this place; and they will slay me for my wife's sake.

01:020:012 And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my
           father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my
           wife.

01:020:013 And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my
           father's house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness
           which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall
           come, say of me, He is my brother.

01:020:014 And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and
           womenservants, and gave them unto Abraham, and restored him
           Sarah his wife.

01:020:015 And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before thee: dwell
           where it pleaseth thee.

01:020:016 And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a
           thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a covering of
           the eyes, unto all that are with thee, and with all other:
           thus she was reproved.

01:020:017 So Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abimelech, and his
           wife, and his maidservants; and they bare children.

01:020:018 For the LORD had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of
           Abimelech, because of Sarah Abraham's wife.

01:021:001 And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did
           unto Sarah as he had spoken.

01:021:002 For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at
           the set time of which God had spoken to him.

01:021:003 And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him,
           whom Sarah bare to him, Isaac.

01:021:004 And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight days old, as
           God had commanded him.

01:021:005 And Abraham was an hundred years old, when his son Isaac was
           born unto him.

01:021:006 And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh, so that all that
           hear will laugh with me.

01:021:007 And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah
           should have given children suck? for I have born him a son in
           his old age.

01:021:008 And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great
           feast the same day that Isaac was weaned.

01:021:009 And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had
           born unto Abraham, mocking.

01:021:010 Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and
           her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with
           my son, even with Isaac.

01:021:011 And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight because of
           his son.

01:021:012 And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight
           because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that
           Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in
           Isaac shall thy seed be called.

01:021:013 And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation,
           because he is thy seed.

01:021:014 And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and
           a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her
           shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed,
           and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba.

01:021:015 And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child
           under one of the shrubs.

01:021:016 And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way
           off, as it were a bow shot: for she said, Let me not see the
           death of the child. And she sat over against him, and lift up
           her voice, and wept.

01:021:017 And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God
           called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth
           thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad
           where he is.

01:021:018 Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will
           make him a great nation.

01:021:019 And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she
           went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad
           drink.

01:021:020 And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the
           wilderness, and became an archer.

01:021:021 And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took
           him a wife out of the land of Egypt.

01:021:022 And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol
           the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God
           is with thee in all that thou doest:

01:021:023 Now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not
           deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son's son:
           but according to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou
           shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned.

01:021:024 And Abraham said, I will swear.

01:021:025 And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water,
           which Abimelech's servants had violently taken away.

01:021:026 And Abimelech said, I wot not who hath done this thing;
           neither didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I of it, but to
           day.

01:021:027 And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech;
           and both of them made a covenant.

01:021:028 And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.

01:021:029 And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What mean these seven ewe
           lambs which thou hast set by themselves?

01:021:030 And he said, For these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my
           hand, that they may be a witness unto me, that I have digged
           this well.

01:021:031 Wherefore he called that place Beersheba; because there they
           sware both of them.

01:021:032 Thus they made a covenant at Beersheba: then Abimelech rose
           up, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they
           returned into the land of the Philistines.

01:021:033 And Abraham planted a grove in Beersheba, and called there on
           the name of the LORD, the everlasting God.

01:021:034 And Abraham sojourned in the Philistines' land many days.

01:022:001 And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt
           Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here
           I am.

01:022:002 And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou
           lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him
           there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I
           will tell thee of.

01:022:003 And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass,
           and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and
           clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went
           unto the place of which God had told him.

01:022:004 Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the
           place afar off.

01:022:005 And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the
           ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come
           again to you.

01:022:006 And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it
           upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a
           knife; and they went both of them together.

01:022:007 And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father:
           and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire
           and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?

01:022:008 And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for
           a burnt offering: so they went both of them together.

01:022:009 And they came to the place which God had told him of; and
           Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and
           bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.

01:022:010 And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to
           slay his son.

01:022:011 And the angel of the LORD called unto him out of heaven, and
           said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I.

01:022:012 And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou
           any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God,
           seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me.

01:022:013 And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind
           him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went
           and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in
           the stead of his son.

01:022:014 And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovahjireh: as it
           is said to this day, In the mount of the LORD it shall be
           seen.

01:022:015 And the angel of the LORD called unto Abraham out of heaven
           the second time,

01:022:016 And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the LORD, for because
           thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son,
           thine only son:

01:022:017 That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will
           multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand
           which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the
           gate of his enemies;

01:022:018 And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed;
           because thou hast obeyed my voice.

01:022:019 So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and
           went together to Beersheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beersheba.

01:022:020 And it came to pass after these things, that it was told
           Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children
           unto thy brother Nahor;

01:022:021 Huz his firstborn, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father
           of Aram,

01:022:022 And Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel.

01:022:023 And Bethuel begat Rebekah: these eight Milcah did bear to
           Nahor, Abraham's brother.

01:022:024 And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah,
           and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah.

01:023:001 And Sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old: these
           were the years of the life of Sarah.

01:023:002 And Sarah died in Kirjatharba; the same is Hebron in the land
           of Canaan: and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep
           for her.

01:023:003 And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spake unto the
           sons of Heth, saying,

01:023:004 I am a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession
           of a buryingplace with you, that I may bury my dead out of my
           sight.

01:023:005 And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him,

01:023:006 Hear us, my lord: thou art a mighty prince among us: in the
           choice of our sepulchres bury thy dead; none of us shall
           withhold from thee his sepulchre, but that thou mayest bury
           thy dead.

01:023:007 And Abraham stood up, and bowed himself to the people of the
           land, even to the children of Heth.

01:023:008 And he communed with them, saying, If it be your mind that I
           should bury my dead out of my sight; hear me, and intreat for
           me to Ephron the son of Zohar,

01:023:009 That he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he hath,
           which is in the end of his field; for as much money as it is
           worth he shall give it me for a possession of a buryingplace
           amongst you.

01:023:010 And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth: and Ephron the
           Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of
           Heth, even of all that went in at the gate of his city,
           saying,

01:023:011 Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave
           that is therein, I give it thee; in the presence of the sons
           of my people give I it thee: bury thy dead.

01:023:012 And Abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land.

01:023:013 And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the
           land, saying, But if thou wilt give it, I pray thee, hear me:
           I will give thee money for the field; take it of me, and I
           will bury my dead there.

01:023:014 And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him,

01:023:015 My lord, hearken unto me: the land is worth four hundred
           shekels of silver; what is that betwixt me and thee? bury
           therefore thy dead.

01:023:016 And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to
           Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the
           sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money
           with the merchant.

01:023:017 And the field of Ephron which was in Machpelah, which was
           before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and
           all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the
           borders round about, were made sure

01:023:018 Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children
           of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city.

01:023:019 And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of
           the field of Machpelah before Mamre: the same is Hebron in the
           land of Canaan.

01:023:020 And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure
           unto Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of
           Heth.

01:024:001 And Abraham was old, and well stricken in age: and the LORD
           had blessed Abraham in all things.

01:024:002 And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house, that
           ruled over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under
           my thigh:

01:024:003 And I will make thee swear by the LORD, the God of heaven, and
           the God of the earth, that thou shalt not take a wife unto my
           son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell:

01:024:004 But thou shalt go unto my country, and to my kindred, and take
           a wife unto my son Isaac.

01:024:005 And the servant said unto him, Peradventure the woman will not
           be willing to follow me unto this land: must I needs bring thy
           son again unto the land from whence thou camest?

01:024:006 And Abraham said unto him, Beware thou that thou bring not my
           son thither again.

01:024:007 The LORD God of heaven, which took me from my father's house,
           and from the land of my kindred, and which spake unto me, and
           that sware unto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this
           land; he shall send his angel before thee, and thou shalt take
           a wife unto my son from thence.

01:024:008 And if the woman will not be willing to follow thee, then thou
           shalt be clear from this my oath: only bring not my son
           thither again.

01:024:009 And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his
           master, and sware to him concerning that matter.

01:024:010 And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master,
           and departed; for all the goods of his master were in his
           hand: and he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, unto the city of
           Nahor.

01:024:011 And he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a
           well of water at the time of the evening, even the time that
           women go out to draw water.

01:024:012 And he said O LORD God of my master Abraham, I pray thee, send
           me good speed this day, and shew kindness unto my master
           Abraham.

01:024:013 Behold, I stand here by the well of water; and the daughters
           of the men of the city come out to draw water:

01:024:014 And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say,
           Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she
           shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: let
           the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant
           Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed kindness
           unto my master.

01:024:015 And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that,
           behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel, son of
           Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother, with her pitcher
           upon her shoulder.

01:024:016 And the damsel was very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither
           had any man known her: and she went down to the well, and
           filled her pitcher, and came up.

01:024:017 And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray
           thee, drink a little water of thy pitcher.

01:024:018 And she said, Drink, my lord: and she hasted, and let down her
           pitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink.

01:024:019 And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will draw
           water for thy camels also, until they have done drinking.

01:024:020 And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and
           ran again unto the well to draw water, and drew for all his
           camels.

01:024:021 And the man wondering at her held his peace, to wit whether
           the LORD had made his journey prosperous or not.

01:024:022 And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that the
           man took a golden earring of half a shekel weight, and two
           bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold;

01:024:023 And said, Whose daughter art thou? tell me, I pray thee: is
           there room in thy father's house for us to lodge in?

01:024:024 And she said unto him, I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of
           Milcah, which she bare unto Nahor.

01:024:025 She said moreover unto him, We have both straw and provender
           enough, and room to lodge in.

01:024:026 And the man bowed down his head, and worshipped the LORD.

01:024:027 And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of my master Abraham, who
           hath not left destitute my master of his mercy and his truth:
           I being in the way, the LORD led me to the house of my
           master's brethren.

01:024:028 And the damsel ran, and told them of her mother's house these
           things.

01:024:029 And Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban: and Laban
           ran out unto the man, unto the well.

01:024:030 And it came to pass, when he saw the earring and bracelets
           upon his sister's hands, and when he heard the words of
           Rebekah his sister, saying, Thus spake the man unto me; that
           he came unto the man; and, behold, he stood by the camels at
           the well.

01:024:031 And he said, Come in, thou blessed of the LORD; wherefore
           standest thou without? for I have prepared the house, and room
           for the camels.

01:024:032 And the man came into the house: and he ungirded his camels,
           and gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash
           his feet, and the men's feet that were with him.

01:024:033 And there was set meat before him to eat: but he said, I will
           not eat, until I have told mine errand. And he said, Speak on.

01:024:034 And he said, I am Abraham's servant.

01:024:035 And the LORD hath blessed my master greatly; and he is become
           great: and he hath given him flocks, and herds, and silver,
           and gold, and menservants, and maidservants, and camels, and
           asses.

01:024:036 And Sarah my master's wife bare a son to my master when she
           was old: and unto him hath he given all that he hath.

01:024:037 And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a
           wife to my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose
           land I dwell:

01:024:038 But thou shalt go unto my father's house, and to my kindred,
           and take a wife unto my son.

01:024:039 And I said unto my master, Peradventure the woman will not
           follow me.

01:024:040 And he said unto me, The LORD, before whom I walk, will send
           his angel with thee, and prosper thy way; and thou shalt take
           a wife for my son of my kindred, and of my father's house:

01:024:041 Then shalt thou be clear from this my oath, when thou comest
           to my kindred; and if they give not thee one, thou shalt be
           clear from my oath.

01:024:042 And I came this day unto the well, and said, O LORD God of my
           master Abraham, if now thou do prosper my way which I go:

01:024:043 Behold, I stand by the well of water; and it shall come to
           pass, that when the virgin cometh forth to draw water, and I
           say to her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water of thy
           pitcher to drink;

01:024:044 And she say to me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for
           thy camels: let the same be the woman whom the LORD hath
           appointed out for my master's son.

01:024:045 And before I had done speaking in mine heart, behold, Rebekah
           came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down
           unto the well, and drew water: and I said unto her, Let me
           drink, I pray thee.

01:024:046 And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her
           shoulder, and said, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink
           also: so I drank, and she made the camels drink also.

01:024:047 And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter art thou? And she
           said, the daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bare
           unto him: and I put the earring upon her face, and the
           bracelets upon her hands.

01:024:048 And I bowed down my head, and worshipped the LORD, and blessed
           the LORD God of my master Abraham, which had led me in the
           right way to take my master's brother's daughter unto his son.

01:024:049 And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell
           me: and if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or
           to the left.

01:024:050 Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceedeth
           from the LORD: we cannot speak unto thee bad or good.

01:024:051 Behold, Rebekah is before thee, take her, and go, and let her
           be thy master's son's wife, as the LORD hath spoken.

01:024:052 And it came to pass, that, when Abraham's servant heard their
           words, he worshipped the LORD, bowing himself to the earth.

01:024:053 And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of
           gold, and raiment, and gave them to Rebekah: he gave also to
           her brother and to her mother precious things.

01:024:054 And they did eat and drink, he and the men that were with him,
           and tarried all night; and they rose up in the morning, and he
           said, Send me away unto my master.

01:024:055 And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with
           us a few days, at the least ten; after that she shall go.

01:024:056 And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing the LORD hath
           prospered my way; send me away that I may go to my master.

01:024:057 And they said, We will call the damsel, and enquire at her
           mouth.

01:024:058 And they called Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt thou go with
           this man? And she said, I will go.

01:024:059 And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and
           Abraham's servant, and his men.

01:024:060 And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, Thou art our
           sister, be thou the mother of thousands of millions, and let
           thy seed possess the gate of those which hate them.

01:024:061 And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the
           camels, and followed the man: and the servant took Rebekah,
           and went his way.

01:024:062 And Isaac came from the way of the well Lahairoi; for he dwelt
           in the south country.

01:024:063 And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide:
           and he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, the camels
           were coming.

01:024:064 And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she
           lighted off the camel.

01:024:065 For she had said unto the servant, What man is this that
           walketh in the field to meet us? And the servant had said, It
           is my master: therefore she took a vail, and covered herself.

01:024:066 And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done.

01:024:067 And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent, and took
           Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her: and Isaac
           was comforted after his mother's death.

01:025:001 Then again Abraham took a wife, and her name was Keturah.

01:025:002 And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian,
           and Ishbak, and Shuah.

01:025:003 And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were
           Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim.

01:025:004 And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and
           Abidah, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah.

01:025:005 And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac.

01:025:006 But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had,
           Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son,
           while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country.

01:025:007 And these are the days of the years of Abraham's life which he
           lived, an hundred threescore and fifteen years.

01:025:008 Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an
           old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people.

01:025:009 And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of
           Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the
           Hittite, which is before Mamre;

01:025:010 The field which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth: there
           was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife.

01:025:011 And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God
           blessed his son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahairoi.

01:025:012 Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom
           Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bare unto Abraham:

01:025:013 And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their
           names, according to their generations: the firstborn of
           Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,

01:025:014 And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,

01:025:015 Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah:

01:025:016 These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by
           their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to
           their nations.

01:025:017 And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and
           thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and
           was gathered unto his people.

01:025:018 And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that is before Egypt,
           as thou goest toward Assyria: and he died in the presence of
           all his brethren.

01:025:019 And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son: Abraham
           begat Isaac:

01:025:020 And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife,
           the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padanaram, the sister to
           Laban the Syrian.

01:025:021 And Isaac intreated the LORD for his wife, because she was
           barren: and the LORD was intreated of him, and Rebekah his
           wife conceived.

01:025:022 And the children struggled together within her; and she said,
           If it be so, why am I thus? And she went to enquire of the
           LORD.

01:025:023 And the LORD said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, and
           two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and
           the one people shall be stronger than the other people; and
           the elder shall serve the younger.

01:025:024 And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold,
           there were twins in her womb.

01:025:025 And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment;
           and they called his name Esau.

01:025:026 And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on
           Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was
           threescore years old when she bare them.

01:025:027 And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the
           field; and Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents.

01:025:028 And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison: but
           Rebekah loved Jacob.

01:025:029 And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he
           was faint:

01:025:030 And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same
           red pottage; for I am faint: therefore was his name called
           Edom.

01:025:031 And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright.

01:025:032 And Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die: and what
           profit shall this birthright do to me?

01:025:033 And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he sware unto him:
           and he sold his birthright unto Jacob.

01:025:034 Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did
           eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau
           despised his birthright.

01:026:001 And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine
           that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech
           king of the Philistines unto Gerar.

01:026:002 And the LORD appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into
           Egypt; dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of:

01:026:003 Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless
           thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these
           countries, and I will perform the oath which I sware unto
           Abraham thy father;

01:026:004 And I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven,
           and will give unto thy seed all these countries; and in thy
           seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed;

01:026:005 Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my
           commandments, my statutes, and my laws.

01:026:006 And Isaac dwelt in Gerar:

01:026:007 And the men of the place asked him of his wife; and he said,
           She is my sister: for he feared to say, She is my wife; lest,
           said he, the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah;
           because she was fair to look upon.

01:026:008 And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that
           Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and
           saw, and, behold, Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife.

01:026:009 And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she
           is thy wife; and how saidst thou, She is my sister? And Isaac
           said unto him, Because I said, Lest I die for her.

01:026:010 And Abimelech said, What is this thou hast done unto us? one
           of the people might lightly have lien with thy wife, and thou
           shouldest have brought guiltiness upon us.

01:026:011 And Abimelech charged all his people, saying, He that toucheth
           this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.

01:026:012 Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year
           an hundredfold: and the LORD blessed him.

01:026:013 And the man waxed great, and went forward, and grew until he
           became very great:

01:026:014 For he had possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and
           great store of servants: and the Philistines envied him.

01:026:015 For all the wells which his father's servants had digged in
           the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped
           them, and filled them with earth.

01:026:016 And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us; for thou art much
           mightier than we.

01:026:017 And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley
           of Gerar, and dwelt there.

01:026:018 And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had
           digged in the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines
           had stopped them after the death of Abraham: and he called
           their names after the names by which his father had called
           them.

01:026:019 And Isaac's servants digged in the valley, and found there a
           well of springing water.

01:026:020 And the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac's herdmen,
           saying, The water is ours: and he called the name of the well
           Esek; because they strove with him.

01:026:021 And they digged another well, and strove for that also: and he
           called the name of it Sitnah.

01:026:022 And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for
           that they strove not: and he called the name of it Rehoboth;
           and he said, For now the LORD hath made room for us, and we
           shall be fruitful in the land.

01:026:023 And he went up from thence to Beersheba.

01:026:024 And the LORD appeared unto him the same night, and said, I am
           the God of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I am with thee,
           and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant
           Abraham's sake.

01:026:025 And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of the
           LORD, and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac's servants
           digged a well.

01:026:026 Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his
           friends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army.

01:026:027 And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing ye
           hate me, and have sent me away from you?

01:026:028 And they said, We saw certainly that the LORD was with thee:
           and we said, Let there be now an oath betwixt us, even betwixt
           us and thee, and let us make a covenant with thee;

01:026:029 That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and
           as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have sent thee
           away in peace: thou art now the blessed of the LORD.

01:026:030 And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink.

01:026:031 And they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to
           another: and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him
           in peace.

01:026:032 And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac's servants came,
           and told him concerning the well which they had digged, and
           said unto him, We have found water.

01:026:033 And he called it Shebah: therefore the name of the city is
           Beersheba unto this day.

01:026:034 And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith the
           daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of
           Elon the Hittite:

01:026:035 Which were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah.

01:027:001 And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes
           were dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his eldest
           son, and said unto him, My son: and he said unto him, Behold,
           here am I.

01:027:002 And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my
           death:

01:027:003 Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver and
           thy bow, and go out to the field, and take me some venison;

01:027:004 And make me savoury meat, such as I love, and bring it to me,
           that I may eat; that my soul may bless thee before I die.

01:027:005 And Rebekah heard when Isaac spake to Esau his son. And Esau
           went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it.

01:027:006 And Rebekah spake unto Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard
           thy father speak unto Esau thy brother, saying,

01:027:007 Bring me venison, and make me savoury meat, that I may eat,
           and bless thee before the LORD before my death.

01:027:008 Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I
           command thee.

01:027:009 Go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence two good kids of
           the goats; and I will make them savoury meat for thy father,
           such as he loveth:

01:027:010 And thou shalt bring it to thy father, that he may eat, and
           that he may bless thee before his death.

01:027:011 And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother
           is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man:

01:027:012 My father peradventure will feel me, and I shall seem to him
           as a deceiver; and I shall bring a curse upon me, and not a
           blessing.

01:027:013 And his mother said unto him, Upon me be thy curse, my son:
           only obey my voice, and go fetch me them.

01:027:014 And he went, and fetched, and brought them to his mother: and
           his mother made savoury meat, such as his father loved.

01:027:015 And Rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau, which
           were with her in the house, and put them upon Jacob her
           younger son:

01:027:016 And she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands,
           and upon the smooth of his neck:

01:027:017 And she gave the savoury meat and the bread, which she had
           prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.

01:027:018 And he came unto his father, and said, My father: and he said,
           Here am I; who art thou, my son?

01:027:019 And Jacob said unto his father, I am Esau thy first born; I
           have done according as thou badest me: arise, I pray thee, sit
           and eat of my venison, that thy soul may bless me.

01:027:020 And Isaac said unto his son, How is it that thou hast found it
           so quickly, my son? And he said, Because the LORD thy God
           brought it to me.

01:027:021 And Isaac said unto Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I may
           feel thee, my son, whether thou be my very son Esau or not.

01:027:022 And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father; and he felt him,
           and said, The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the
           hands of Esau.

01:027:023 And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his
           brother Esau's hands: so he blessed him.

01:027:024 And he said, Art thou my very son Esau? And he said, I am.

01:027:025 And he said, Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son's
           venison, that my soul may bless thee. And he brought it near
           to him, and he did eat: and he brought him wine and he drank.

01:027:026 And his father Isaac said unto him, Come near now, and kiss
           me, my son.

01:027:027 And he came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the smell of
           his raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my
           son is as the smell of a field which the LORD hath blessed:

01:027:028 Therefore God give thee of the dew of heaven, and the fatness
           of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine:

01:027:029 Let people serve thee, and nations bow down to thee: be lord
           over thy brethren, and let thy mother's sons bow down to thee:
           cursed be every one that curseth thee, and blessed be he that
           blesseth thee.

01:027:030 And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of
           blessing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the
           presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in
           from his hunting.

01:027:031 And he also had made savoury meat, and brought it unto his
           father, and said unto his father, Let my father arise, and eat
           of his son's venison, that thy soul may bless me.

01:027:032 And Isaac his father said unto him, Who art thou? And he said,
           I am thy son, thy firstborn Esau.

01:027:033 And Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who? where is
           he that hath taken venison, and brought it me, and I have
           eaten of all before thou camest, and have blessed him? yea,
           and he shall be blessed.

01:027:034 And when Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with a
           great and exceeding bitter cry, and said unto his father,
           Bless me, even me also, O my father.

01:027:035 And he said, Thy brother came with subtilty, and hath taken
           away thy blessing.

01:027:036 And he said, Is not he rightly named Jacob? for he hath
           supplanted me these two times: he took away my birthright;
           and, behold, now he hath taken away my blessing. And he said,
           Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me?

01:027:037 And Isaac answered and said unto Esau, Behold, I have made him
           thy lord, and all his brethren have I given to him for
           servants; and with corn and wine have I sustained him: and
           what shall I do now unto thee, my son?

01:027:038 And Esau said unto his father, Hast thou but one blessing, my
           father? bless me, even me also, O my father. And Esau lifted
           up his voice, and wept.

01:027:039 And Isaac his father answered and said unto him, Behold, thy
           dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of
           heaven from above;

01:027:040 And by thy sword shalt thou live, and shalt serve thy brother;
           and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion,
           that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck.

01:027:041 And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his
           father blessed him: and Esau said in his heart, The days of
           mourning for my father are at hand; then will I slay my
           brother Jacob.

01:027:042 And these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah:
           and she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said unto
           him, Behold, thy brother Esau, as touching thee, doth comfort
           himself, purposing to kill thee.

01:027:043 Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; arise, flee thou to
           Laban my brother to Haran;

01:027:044 And tarry with him a few days, until thy brother's fury turn
           away;

01:027:045 Until thy brother's anger turn away from thee, and he forget
           that which thou hast done to him: then I will send, and fetch
           thee from thence: why should I be deprived also of you both in
           one day?

01:027:046 And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of
           the daughters of Heth: if Jacob take a wife of the daughters
           of Heth, such as these which are of the daughters of the land,
           what good shall my life do me?

01:028:001 And Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and charged him, and
           said unto him, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of
           Canaan.

01:028:002 Arise, go to Padanaram, to the house of Bethuel thy mother's
           father; and take thee a wife from thence of the daughers of
           Laban thy mother's brother.

01:028:003 And God Almighty bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and
           multiply thee, that thou mayest be a multitude of people;

01:028:004 And give thee the blessing of Abraham, to thee, and to thy
           seed with thee; that thou mayest inherit the land wherein thou
           art a stranger, which God gave unto Abraham.

01:028:005 And Isaac sent away Jacob: and he went to Padanaram unto
           Laban, son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah,
           Jacob's and Esau's mother.

01:028:006 When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob, and sent him away
           to Padanaram, to take him a wife from thence; and that as he
           blessed him he gave him a charge, saying, Thou shalt not take
           a wife of the daughers of Canaan;

01:028:007 And that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother, and was gone
           to Padanaram;

01:028:008 And Esau seeing that the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac
           his father;

01:028:009 Then went Esau unto Ishmael, and took unto the wives which he
           had Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abraham's son, the sister
           of Nebajoth, to be his wife.

01:028:010 And Jacob went out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran.

01:028:011 And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all
           night, because the sun was set; and he took of the stones of
           that place, and put them for his pillows, and lay down in that
           place to sleep.

01:028:012 And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and
           the top of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God
           ascending and descending on it.

01:028:013 And, behold, the LORD stood above it, and said, I am the LORD
           God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: the land
           whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed;

01:028:014 And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt
           spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north,
           and to the south: and in thee and in thy seed shall all the
           families of the earth be blessed.

01:028:015 And, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places
           whither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land;
           for I will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have
           spoken to thee of.

01:028:016 And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the
           LORD is in this place; and I knew it not.

01:028:017 And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! this
           is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of
           heaven.

01:028:018 And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone
           that he had put for his pillows, and set it up for a pillar,
           and poured oil upon the top of it.

01:028:019 And he called the name of that place Bethel: but the name of
           that city was called Luz at the first.

01:028:020 And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and
           will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to
           eat, and raiment to put on,

01:028:021 So that I come again to my father's house in peace; then shall
           the LORD be my God:

01:028:022 And this stone, which I have set for a pillar, shall be God's
           house: and of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give
           the tenth unto thee.

01:029:001 Then Jacob went on his journey, and came into the land of the
           people of the east.

01:029:002 And he looked, and behold a well in the field, and, lo, there
           were three flocks of sheep lying by it; for out of that well
           they watered the flocks: and a great stone was upon the well's
           mouth.

01:029:003 And thither were all the flocks gathered: and they rolled the
           stone from the well's mouth, and watered the sheep, and put
           the stone again upon the well's mouth in his place.

01:029:004 And Jacob said unto them, My brethren, whence be ye? And they
           said, Of Haran are we.

01:029:005 And he said unto them, Know ye Laban the son of Nahor? And
           they said, We know him.

01:029:006 And he said unto them, Is he well? And they said, He is well:
           and, behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep.

01:029:007 And he said, Lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time that
           the cattle should be gathered together: water ye the sheep,
           and go and feed them.

01:029:008 And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered
           together, and till they roll the stone from the well's mouth;
           then we water the sheep.

01:029:009 And while he yet spake with them, Rachel came with her
           father's sheep; for she kept them.

01:029:010 And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of
           Laban his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his
           mother's brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone
           from the well's mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his
           mother's brother.

01:029:011 And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept.

01:029:012 And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's brother, and
           that he was Rebekah's son: and she ran and told her father.

01:029:013 And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his
           sister's son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and
           kissed him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban
           all these things.

01:029:014 And Laban said to him, Surely thou art my bone and my flesh.
           And he abode with him the space of a month.

01:029:015 And Laban said unto Jacob, Because thou art my brother,
           shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought? tell me, what
           shall thy wages be?

01:029:016 And Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder was Leah,
           and the name of the younger was Rachel.

01:029:017 Leah was tender eyed; but Rachel was beautiful and well
           favoured.

01:029:018 And Jacob loved Rachel; and said, I will serve thee seven
           years for Rachel thy younger daughter.

01:029:019 And Laban said, It is better that I give her to thee, than
           that I should give her to another man: abide with me.

01:029:020 And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto
           him but a few days, for the love he had to her.

01:029:021 And Jacob said unto Laban, Give me my wife, for my days are
           fulfilled, that I may go in unto her.

01:029:022 And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made
           a feast.

01:029:023 And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his
           daughter, and brought her to him; and he went in unto her.

01:029:024 And Laban gave unto his daughter Leah Zilpah his maid for an
           handmaid.

01:029:025 And it came to pass, that in the morning, behold, it was Leah:
           and he said to Laban, What is this thou hast done unto me? did
           not I serve with thee for Rachel? wherefore then hast thou
           beguiled me?

01:029:026 And Laban said, It must not be so done in our country, to give
           the younger before the firstborn.

01:029:027 Fulfil her week, and we will give thee this also for the
           service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years.

01:029:028 And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week: and he gave him
           Rachel his daughter to wife also.

01:029:029 And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to
           be her maid.

01:029:030 And he went in also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more
           than Leah, and served with him yet seven other years.

01:029:031 And when the LORD saw that Leah was hated, he opened her womb:
           but Rachel was barren.

01:029:032 And Leah conceived, and bare a son, and she called his name
           Reuben: for she said, Surely the LORD hath looked upon my
           affliction; now therefore my husband will love me.

01:029:033 And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Because the
           LORD hath heard I was hated, he hath therefore given me this
           son also: and she called his name Simeon.

01:029:034 And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Now this
           time will my husband be joined unto me, because I have born
           him three sons: therefore was his name called Levi.

01:029:035 And she conceived again, and bare a son: and she said, Now
           will I praise the LORD: therefore she called his name Judah;
           and left bearing.

01:030:001 And when Rachel saw that she bare Jacob no children, Rachel
           envied her sister; and said unto Jacob, Give me children, or
           else I die.

01:030:002 And Jacob's anger was kindled against Rachel: and he said, Am
           I in God's stead, who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the
           womb?

01:030:003 And she said, Behold my maid Bilhah, go in unto her; and she
           shall bear upon my knees, that I may also have children by
           her.

01:030:004 And she gave him Bilhah her handmaid to wife: and Jacob went
           in unto her.

01:030:005 And Bilhah conceived, and bare Jacob a son.

01:030:006 And Rachel said, God hath judged me, and hath also heard my
           voice, and hath given me a son: therefore called she his name
           Dan.

01:030:007 And Bilhah Rachel's maid conceived again, and bare Jacob a
           second son.

01:030:008 And Rachel said, With great wrestlings have I wrestled with my
           sister, and I have prevailed: and she called his name
           Naphtali.

01:030:009 When Leah saw that she had left bearing, she took Zilpah her
           maid, and gave her Jacob to wife.

01:030:010 And Zilpah Leah's maid bare Jacob a son.

01:030:011 And Leah said, A troop cometh: and she called his name Gad.

01:030:012 And Zilpah Leah's maid bare Jacob a second son.

01:030:013 And Leah said, Happy am I, for the daughters will call me
           blessed: and she called his name Asher.

01:030:014 And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found
           mandrakes in the field, and brought them unto his mother Leah.
           Then Rachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray thee, of thy son's
           mandrakes.

01:030:015 And she said unto her, Is it a small matter that thou hast
           taken my husband? and wouldest thou take away my son's
           mandrakes also? And Rachel said, Therefore he shall lie with
           thee to night for thy son's mandrakes.

01:030:016 And Jacob came out of the field in the evening, and Leah went
           out to meet him, and said, Thou must come in unto me; for
           surely I have hired thee with my son's mandrakes. And he lay
           with her that night.

01:030:017 And God hearkened unto Leah, and she conceived, and bare Jacob
           the fifth son.

01:030:018 And Leah said, God hath given me my hire, because I have given
           my maiden to my husband: and she called his name Issachar.

01:030:019 And Leah conceived again, and bare Jacob the sixth son.

01:030:020 And Leah said, God hath endued me with a good dowry; now will
           my husband dwell with me, because I have born him six sons:
           and she called his name Zebulun.

01:030:021 And afterwards she bare a daughter, and called her name Dinah.

01:030:022 And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and
           opened her womb.

01:030:023 And she conceived, and bare a son; and said, God hath taken
           away my reproach:

01:030:024 And she called his name Joseph; and said, The LORD shall add
           to me another son.

01:030:025 And it came to pass, when Rachel had born Joseph, that Jacob
           said unto Laban, Send me away, that I may go unto mine own
           place, and to my country.

01:030:026 Give me my wives and my children, for whom I have served thee,
           and let me go: for thou knowest my service which I have done
           thee.

01:030:027 And Laban said unto him, I pray thee, if I have found favour
           in thine eyes, tarry: for I have learned by experience that
           the LORD hath blessed me for thy sake.

01:030:028 And he said, Appoint me thy wages, and I will give it.

01:030:029 And he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and
           how thy cattle was with me.

01:030:030 For it was little which thou hadst before I came, and it is
           now increased unto a multitude; and the LORD hath blessed thee
           since my coming: and now when shall I provide for mine own
           house also?

01:030:031 And he said, What shall I give thee? And Jacob said, Thou
           shalt not give me any thing: if thou wilt do this thing for
           me, I will again feed and keep thy flock.

01:030:032 I will pass through all thy flock to day, removing from thence
           all the speckled and spotted cattle, and all the brown cattle
           among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats:
           and of such shall be my hire.

01:030:033 So shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come, when
           it shall come for my hire before thy face: every one that is
           not speckled and spotted among the goats, and brown among the
           sheep, that shall be counted stolen with me.

01:030:034 And Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to thy
           word.

01:030:035 And he removed that day the he goats that were ringstraked and
           spotted, and all the she goats that were speckled and spotted,
           and every one that had some white in it, and all the brown
           among the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons.

01:030:036 And he set three days' journey betwixt himself and Jacob: and
           Jacob fed the rest of Laban's flocks.

01:030:037 And Jacob took him rods of green poplar, and of the hazel and
           chesnut tree; and pilled white strakes in them, and made the
           white appear which was in the rods.

01:030:038 And he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks in
           the gutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to
           drink, that they should conceive when they came to drink.

01:030:039 And the flocks conceived before the rods, and brought forth
           cattle ringstraked, speckled, and spotted.

01:030:040 And Jacob did separate the lambs, and set the faces of the
           flocks toward the ringstraked, and all the brown in the flock
           of Laban; and he put his own flocks by themselves, and put
           them not unto Laban's cattle.

01:030:041 And it came to pass, whensoever the stronger cattle did
           conceive, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the
           cattle in the gutters, that they might conceive among the
           rods.

01:030:042 But when the cattle were feeble, he put them not in: so the
           feebler were Laban's, and the stronger Jacob's.

01:030:043 And the man increased exceedingly, and had much cattle, and
           maidservants, and menservants, and camels, and asses.

01:031:001 And he heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, Jacob hath
           taken away all that was our father's; and of that which was
           our father's hath he gotten all this glory.

01:031:002 And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it was
           not toward him as before.

01:031:003 And the LORD said unto Jacob, Return unto the land of thy
           fathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee.

01:031:004 And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto
           his flock,

01:031:005 And said unto them, I see your father's countenance, that it
           is not toward me as before; but the God of my father hath been
           with me.

01:031:006 And ye know that with all my power I have served your father.

01:031:007 And your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten
           times; but God suffered him not to hurt me.

01:031:008 If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages; then all the
           cattle bare speckled: and if he said thus, The ringstraked
           shall be thy hire; then bare all the cattle ringstraked.

01:031:009 Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father, and given
           them to me.

01:031:010 And it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived,
           that I lifted up mine eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold,
           the rams which leaped upon the cattle were ringstraked,
           speckled, and grisled.

01:031:011 And the angel of God spake unto me in a dream, saying, Jacob:
           And I said, Here am I.

01:031:012 And he said, Lift up now thine eyes, and see, all the rams
           which leap upon the cattle are ringstraked, speckled, and
           grisled: for I have seen all that Laban doeth unto thee.

01:031:013 I am the God of Bethel, where thou anointedst the pillar, and
           where thou vowedst a vow unto me: now arise, get thee out from
           this land, and return unto the land of thy kindred.

01:031:014 And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him, Is there yet
           any portion or inheritance for us in our father's house?

01:031:015 Are we not counted of him strangers? for he hath sold us, and
           hath quite devoured also our money.

01:031:016 For all the riches which God hath taken from our father, that
           is ours, and our children's: now then, whatsoever God hath
           said unto thee, do.

01:031:017 Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon
           camels;

01:031:018 And he carried away all his cattle, and all his goods which he
           had gotten, the cattle of his getting, which he had gotten in
           Padanaram, for to go to Isaac his father in the land of
           Canaan.

01:031:019 And Laban went to shear his sheep: and Rachel had stolen the
           images that were her father's.

01:031:020 And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he
           told him not that he fled.

01:031:021 So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed
           over the river, and set his face toward the mount Gilead.

01:031:022 And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled.

01:031:023 And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven
           days' journey; and they overtook him in the mount Gilead.

01:031:024 And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night, and said
           unto him, Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good
           or bad.

01:031:025 Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in
           the mount: and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of
           Gilead.

01:031:026 And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast
           stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters, as
           captives taken with the sword?

01:031:027 Wherefore didst thou flee away secretly, and steal away from
           me; and didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away
           with mirth, and with songs, with tabret, and with harp?

01:031:028 And hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters?
           thou hast now done foolishly in so doing.

01:031:029 It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of
           your father spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take thou heed
           that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.

01:031:030 And now, though thou wouldest needs be gone, because thou sore
           longedst after thy father's house, yet wherefore hast thou
           stolen my gods?

01:031:031 And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid:
           for I said, Peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy
           daughters from me.

01:031:032 With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let him not live:
           before our brethren discern thou what is thine with me, and
           take it to thee. For Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen
           them.

01:031:033 And Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and
           into the two maidservants' tents; but he found them not. Then
           went he out of Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel's tent.

01:031:034 Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel's
           furniture, and sat upon them. And Laban searched all the tent,
           but found them not.

01:031:035 And she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that
           I cannot rise up before thee; for the custom of women is upon
           me. And he searched but found not the images.

01:031:036 And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answered
           and said to Laban, What is my trespass? what is my sin, that
           thou hast so hotly pursued after me?

01:031:037 Whereas thou hast searched all my stuff, what hast thou found
           of all thy household stuff? set it here before my brethren and
           thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us both.

01:031:038 This twenty years have I been with thee; thy ewes and thy she
           goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock
           have I not eaten.

01:031:039 That which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee; I bare
           the loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it, whether
           stolen by day, or stolen by night.

01:031:040 Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost
           by night; and my sleep departed from mine eyes.

01:031:041 Thus have I been twenty years in thy house; I served thee
           fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy
           cattle: and thou hast changed my wages ten times.

01:031:042 Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear
           of Isaac, had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away now
           empty. God hath seen mine affliction and the labour of my
           hands, and rebuked thee yesternight.

01:031:043 And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, These daughters are my
           daughters, and these children are my children, and these
           cattle are my cattle, and all that thou seest is mine: and
           what can I do this day unto these my daughters, or unto their
           children which they have born?

01:031:044 Now therefore come thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou;
           and let it be for a witness between me and thee.

01:031:045 And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar.

01:031:046 And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took
           stones, and made an heap: and they did eat there upon the
           heap.

01:031:047 And Laban called it Jegarsahadutha: but Jacob called it
           Galeed.

01:031:048 And Laban said, This heap is a witness between me and thee
           this day. Therefore was the name of it called Galeed;

01:031:049 And Mizpah; for he said, The LORD watch between me and thee,
           when we are absent one from another.

01:031:050 If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take
           other wives beside my daughters, no man is with us; see, God
           is witness betwixt me and thee.

01:031:051 And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold this
           pillar, which I have cast betwixt me and thee:

01:031:052 This heap be witness, and this pillar be witness, that I will
           not pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass
           over this heap and this pillar unto me, for harm.

01:031:053 The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their
           father, judge betwixt us. And Jacob sware by the fear of his
           father Isaac.

01:031:054 Then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount, and called his
           brethren to eat bread: and they did eat bread, and tarried all
           night in the mount.

01:031:055 And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons
           and his daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed, and
           returned unto his place.

01:032:001 And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.

01:032:002 And when Jacob saw them, he said, This is God's host: and he
           called the name of that place Mahanaim.

01:032:003 And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto
           the land of Seir, the country of Edom.

01:032:004 And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak unto my
           lord Esau; Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with
           Laban, and stayed there until now:

01:032:005 And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and menservants, and
           womenservants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may
           find grace in thy sight.

01:032:006 And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy
           brother Esau, and also he cometh to meet thee, and four
           hundred men with him.

01:032:007 Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided
           the people that was with him, and the flocks, and herds, and
           the camels, into two bands;

01:032:008 And said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then
           the other company which is left shall escape.

01:032:009 And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my
           father Isaac, the LORD which saidst unto me, Return unto thy
           country, and to thy kindred, and I will deal well with thee:

01:032:010 I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all
           the truth, which thou hast shewed unto thy servant; for with
           my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two
           bands.

01:032:011 Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the
           hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me,
           and the mother with the children.

01:032:012 And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed
           as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for
           multitude.

01:032:013 And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which
           came to his hand a present for Esau his brother;

01:032:014 Two hundred she goats, and twenty he goats, two hundred ewes,
           and twenty rams,

01:032:015 Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine, and ten
           bulls, twenty she asses, and ten foals.

01:032:016 And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every
           drove by themselves; and said unto his servants, Pass over
           before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove.

01:032:017 And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother
           meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou? and
           whither goest thou? and whose are these before thee?

01:032:018 Then thou shalt say, They be thy servant Jacob's; it is a
           present sent unto my lord Esau: and, behold, also he is behind
           us.

01:032:019 And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that
           followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak
           unto Esau, when ye find him.

01:032:020 And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us.
           For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth
           before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he
           will accept of me.

01:032:021 So went the present over before him: and himself lodged that
           night in the company.

01:032:022 And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two
           womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford
           Jabbok.

01:032:023 And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over
           that he had.

01:032:024 And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him
           until the breaking of the day.

01:032:025 And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched
           the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was
           out of joint, as he wrestled with him.

01:032:026 And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I
           will not let thee go, except thou bless me.

01:032:027 And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob.

01:032:028 And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but
           Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men,
           and hast prevailed.

01:032:029 And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name.
           And he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name?
           And he blessed him there.

01:032:030 And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen
           God face to face, and my life is preserved.

01:032:031 And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he
           halted upon his thigh.

01:032:032 Therefore the children of Israel eat not of the sinew which
           shrank, which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day:
           because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew
           that shrank.

01:033:001 And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau
           came, and with him four hundred men. And he divided the
           children unto Leah, and unto Rachel, and unto the two
           handmaids.

01:033:002 And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah
           and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost.

01:033:003 And he passed over before them, and bowed himself to the
           ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.

01:033:004 And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his
           neck, and kissed him: and they wept.

01:033:005 And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children;
           and said, Who are those with thee? And he said, The children
           which God hath graciously given thy servant.

01:033:006 Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children, and
           they bowed themselves.

01:033:007 And Leah also with her children came near, and bowed
           themselves: and after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they
           bowed themselves.

01:033:008 And he said, What meanest thou by all this drove which I met?
           And he said, These are to find grace in the sight of my lord.

01:033:009 And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; keep that thou hast
           unto thyself.

01:033:010 And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found grace in
           thy sight, then receive my present at my hand: for therefore I
           have seen thy face, as though I had seen the face of God, and
           thou wast pleased with me.

01:033:011 Take, I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee;
           because God hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have
           enough. And he urged him, and he took it.

01:033:012 And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I
           will go before thee.

01:033:013 And he said unto him, My lord knoweth that the children are
           tender, and the flocks and herds with young are with me: and
           if men should overdrive them one day, all the flock will die.

01:033:014 Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant: and I
           will lead on softly, according as the cattle that goeth before
           me and the children be able to endure, until I come unto my
           lord unto Seir.

01:033:015 And Esau said, Let me now leave with thee some of the folk
           that are with me. And he said, What needeth it? let me find
           grace in the sight of my lord.

01:033:016 So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir.

01:033:017 And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him an house, and
           made booths for his cattle: therefore the name of the place is
           called Succoth.

01:033:018 And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which is in the
           land of Canaan, when he came from Padanaram; and pitched his
           tent before the city.

01:033:019 And he bought a parcel of a field, where he had spread his
           tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father,
           for an hundred pieces of money.

01:033:020 And he erected there an altar, and called it EleloheIsrael.

01:034:001 And Dinah the daughter of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob,
           went out to see the daughters of the land.

01:034:002 And when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the
           country, saw her, he took her, and lay with her, and defiled
           her.

01:034:003 And his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he
           loved the damsel, and spake kindly unto the damsel.

01:034:004 And Shechem spake unto his father Hamor, saying, Get me this
           damsel to wife.

01:034:005 And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter: now
           his sons were with his cattle in the field: and Jacob held his
           peace until they were come.

01:034:006 And Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob to commune
           with him.

01:034:007 And the sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard
           it: and the men were grieved, and they were very wroth,
           because he had wrought folly in Israel in lying with Jacob's
           daughter: which thing ought not to be done.

01:034:008 And Hamor communed with them, saying, The soul of my son
           Shechem longeth for your daughter: I pray you give her him to
           wife.

01:034:009 And make ye marriages with us, and give your daughters unto
           us, and take our daughters unto you.

01:034:010 And ye shall dwell with us: and the land shall be before you;
           dwell and trade ye therein, and get you possessions therein.

01:034:011 And Shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren, Let me
           find grace in your eyes, and what ye shall say unto me I will
           give.

01:034:012 Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give according
           as ye shall say unto me: but give me the damsel to wife.

01:034:013 And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father
           deceitfully, and said, because he had defiled Dinah their
           sister:

01:034:014 And they said unto them, We cannot do this thing, to give our
           sister to one that is uncircumcised; for that were a reproach
           unto us:

01:034:015 But in this will we consent unto you: If ye will be as we be,
           that every male of you be circumcised;

01:034:016 Then will we give our daughters unto you, and we will take
           your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will
           become one people.

01:034:017 But if ye will not hearken unto us, to be circumcised; then
           will we take our daughter, and we will be gone.

01:034:018 And their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor's son.

01:034:019 And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had
           delight in Jacob's daughter: and he was more honourable than
           all the house of his father.

01:034:020 And Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their
           city, and communed with the men of their city, saying,

01:034:021 These men are peaceable with us; therefore let them dwell in
           the land, and trade therein; for the land, behold, it is large
           enough for them; let us take their daughters to us for wives,
           and let us give them our daughters.

01:034:022 Only herein will the men consent unto us for to dwell with us,
           to be one people, if every male among us be circumcised, as
           they are circumcised.

01:034:023 Shall not their cattle and their substance and every beast of
           their's be our's? only let us consent unto them, and they will
           dwell with us.

01:034:024 And unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that
           went out of the gate of his city; and every male was
           circumcised, all that went out of the gate of his city.

01:034:025 And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore,
           that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's
           brethren, took each man his sword, and came upon the city
           boldly, and slew all the males.

01:034:026 And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the
           sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem's house, and went out.

01:034:027 The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and spoiled the city,
           because they had defiled their sister.

01:034:028 They took their sheep, and their oxen, and their asses, and
           that which was in the city, and that which was in the field,

01:034:029 And all their wealth, and all their little ones, and their
           wives took they captive, and spoiled even all that was in the
           house.

01:034:030 And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me to make
           me to stink among the inhabitants of the land, among the
           Canaanites and the Perizzites: and I being few in number, they
           shall gather themselves together against me, and slay me; and
           I shall be destroyed, I and my house.

01:034:031 And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with an
           harlot?

01:035:001 And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell
           there: and make there an altar unto God, that appeared unto
           thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother.

01:035:002 Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with
           him, Put away the strange gods that are among you, and be
           clean, and change your garments:

01:035:003 And let us arise, and go up to Bethel; and I will make there
           an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress,
           and was with me in the way which I went.

01:035:004 And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were in
           their hand, and all their earrings which were in their ears;
           and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem.

01:035:005 And they journeyed: and the terror of God was upon the cities
           that were round about them, and they did not pursue after the
           sons of Jacob.

01:035:006 So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan, that is,
           Bethel, he and all the people that were with him.

01:035:007 And he built there an altar, and called the place Elbethel:
           because there God appeared unto him, when he fled from the
           face of his brother.

01:035:008 But Deborah Rebekah's nurse died, and she was buried beneath
           Bethel under an oak: and the name of it was called
           Allonbachuth.

01:035:009 And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came out of
           Padanaram, and blessed him.

01:035:010 And God said unto him, Thy name is Jacob: thy name shall not
           be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name: and he
           called his name Israel.

01:035:011 And God said unto him, I am God Almighty: be fruitful and
           multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee,
           and kings shall come out of thy loins;

01:035:012 And the land which I gave Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will
           give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land.

01:035:013 And God went up from him in the place where he talked with
           him.

01:035:014 And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with
           him, even a pillar of stone: and he poured a drink offering
           thereon, and he poured oil thereon.

01:035:015 And Jacob called the name of the place where God spake with
           him, Bethel.

01:035:016 And they journeyed from Bethel; and there was but a little way
           to come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard
           labour.

01:035:017 And it came to pass, when she was in hard labour, that the
           midwife said unto her, Fear not; thou shalt have this son
           also.

01:035:018 And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing, (for she
           died) that she called his name Benoni: but his father called
           him Benjamin.

01:035:019 And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath, which
           is Bethlehem.

01:035:020 And Jacob set a pillar upon her grave: that is the pillar of
           Rachel's grave unto this day.

01:035:021 And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of
           Edar.

01:035:022 And it came to pass, when Israel dwelt in that land, that
           Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine: and
           Israel heard it. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve:

01:035:023 The sons of Leah; Reuben, Jacob's firstborn, and Simeon, and
           Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun:

01:035:024 The sons of Rachel; Joseph, and Benjamin:

01:035:025 And the sons of Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid; Dan, and Naphtali:

01:035:026 And the sons of Zilpah, Leah's handmaid: Gad, and Asher: these
           are the sons of Jacob, which were born to him in Padanaram.

01:035:027 And Jacob came unto Isaac his father unto Mamre, unto the city
           of Arbah, which is Hebron, where Abraham and Isaac sojourned.

01:035:028 And the days of Isaac were an hundred and fourscore years.

01:035:029 And Isaac gave up the ghost, and died, and was gathered unto
           his people, being old and full of days: and his sons Esau and
           Jacob buried him.

01:036:001 Now these are the generations of Esau, who is Edom.

01:036:002 Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan; Adah the
           daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Aholibamah the daughter of
           Anah the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite;

01:036:003 And Bashemath Ishmael's daughter, sister of Nebajoth.

01:036:004 And Adah bare to Esau Eliphaz; and Bashemath bare Reuel;

01:036:005 And Aholibamah bare Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah: these are
           the sons of Esau, which were born unto him in the land of
           Canaan.

01:036:006 And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and
           all the persons of his house, and his cattle, and all his
           beasts, and all his substance, which he had got in the land of
           Canaan; and went into the country from the face of his brother
           Jacob.

01:036:007 For their riches were more than that they might dwell
           together; and the land wherein they were strangers could not
           bear them because of their cattle.

01:036:008 Thus dwelt Esau in mount Seir: Esau is Edom.

01:036:009 And these are the generations of Esau the father of the
           Edomites in mount Seir:

01:036:010 These are the names of Esau's sons; Eliphaz the son of Adah
           the wife of Esau, Reuel the son of Bashemath the wife of Esau.

01:036:011 And the sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Gatam,
           and Kenaz.

01:036:012 And Timna was concubine to Eliphaz Esau's son; and she bare to
           Eliphaz Amalek: these were the sons of Adah Esau's wife.

01:036:013 And these are the sons of Reuel; Nahath, and Zerah, Shammah,
           and Mizzah: these were the sons of Bashemath Esau's wife.

01:036:014 And these were the sons of Aholibamah, the daughter of Anah
           the daughter of Zibeon, Esau's wife: and she bare to Esau
           Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah.

01:036:015 These were dukes of the sons of Esau: the sons of Eliphaz the
           firstborn son of Esau; duke Teman, duke Omar, duke Zepho, duke
           Kenaz,

01:036:016 Duke Korah, duke Gatam, and duke Amalek: these are the dukes
           that came of Eliphaz in the land of Edom; these were the sons
           of Adah.

01:036:017 And these are the sons of Reuel Esau's son; duke Nahath, duke
           Zerah, duke Shammah, duke Mizzah: these are the dukes that
           came of Reuel in the land of Edom; these are the sons of
           Bashemath Esau's wife.

01:036:018 And these are the sons of Aholibamah Esau's wife; duke Jeush,
           duke Jaalam, duke Korah: these were the dukes that came of
           Aholibamah the daughter of Anah, Esau's wife.

01:036:019 These are the sons of Esau, who is Edom, and these are their
           dukes.

01:036:020 These are the sons of Seir the Horite, who inhabited the land;
           Lotan, and Shobal, and Zibeon, and Anah,

01:036:021 And Dishon, and Ezer, and Dishan: these are the dukes of the
           Horites, the children of Seir in the land of Edom.

01:036:022 And the children of Lotan were Hori and Hemam; and Lotan's
           sister was Timna.

01:036:023 And the children of Shobal were these; Alvan, and Manahath,
           and Ebal, Shepho, and Onam.

01:036:024 And these are the children of Zibeon; both Ajah, and Anah:
           this was that Anah that found the mules in the wilderness, as
           he fed the asses of Zibeon his father.

01:036:025 And the children of Anah were these; Dishon, and Aholibamah
           the daughter of Anah.

01:036:026 And these are the children of Dishon; Hemdan, and Eshban, and
           Ithran, and Cheran.

01:036:027 The children of Ezer are these; Bilhan, and Zaavan, and Akan.

01:036:028 The children of Dishan are these; Uz, and Aran.

01:036:029 These are the dukes that came of the Horites; duke Lotan, duke
           Shobal, duke Zibeon, duke Anah,

01:036:030 Duke Dishon, duke Ezer, duke Dishan: these are the dukes that
           came of Hori, among their dukes in the land of Seir.

01:036:031 And these are the kings that reigned in the land of Edom,
           before there reigned any king over the children of Israel.

01:036:032 And Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom: and the name of his
           city was Dinhabah.

01:036:033 And Bela died, and Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrah reigned in
           his stead.

01:036:034 And Jobab died, and Husham of the land of Temani reigned in
           his stead.

01:036:035 And Husham died, and Hadad the son of Bedad, who smote Midian
           in the field of Moab, reigned in his stead: and the name of
           his city was Avith.

01:036:036 And Hadad died, and Samlah of Masrekah reigned in his stead.

01:036:037 And Samlah died, and Saul of Rehoboth by the river reigned in
           his stead.

01:036:038 And Saul died, and Baalhanan the son of Achbor reigned in his
           stead.

01:036:039 And Baalhanan the son of Achbor died, and Hadar reigned in his
           stead: and the name of his city was Pau; and his wife's name
           was Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred, the daughter of
           Mezahab.

01:036:040 And these are the names of the dukes that came of Esau,
           according to their families, after their places, by their
           names; duke Timnah, duke Alvah, duke Jetheth,

01:036:041 Duke Aholibamah, duke Elah, duke Pinon,

01:036:042 Duke Kenaz, duke Teman, duke Mibzar,

01:036:043 Duke Magdiel, duke Iram: these be the dukes of Edom, according
           to their habitations in the land of their possession: he is
           Esau the father of the Edomites.

01:037:001 And Jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was a stranger,
           in the land of Canaan.

01:037:002 These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen
           years old, was feeding the flock with his brethren; and the
           lad was with the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah,
           his father's wives: and Joseph brought unto his father their
           evil report.

01:037:003 Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he
           was the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of many
           colours.

01:037:004 And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more
           than all his brethren, they hated him, and could not speak
           peaceably unto him.

01:037:005 And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it his brethren: and
           they hated him yet the more.

01:037:006 And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I
           have dreamed:

01:037:007 For, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and, lo, my
           sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves
           stood round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf.

01:037:008 And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us?
           or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him
           yet the more for his dreams, and for his words.

01:037:009 And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brethren,
           and said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold,
           the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to
           me.

01:037:010 And he told it to his father, and to his brethren: and his
           father rebuked him, and said unto him, What is this dream that
           thou hast dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren
           indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth?

01:037:011 And his brethren envied him; but his father observed the
           saying.

01:037:012 And his brethren went to feed their father's flock in Shechem.

01:037:013 And Israel said unto Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed the
           flock in Shechem? come, and I will send thee unto them. And he
           said to him, Here am I.

01:037:014 And he said to him, Go, I pray thee, see whether it be well
           with thy brethren, and well with the flocks; and bring me word
           again. So he sent him out of the vale of Hebron, and he came
           to Shechem.

01:037:015 And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering in
           the field: and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou?

01:037:016 And he said, I seek my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, where
           they feed their flocks.

01:037:017 And the man said, They are departed hence; for I heard them
           say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren,
           and found them in Dothan.

01:037:018 And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near unto
           them, they conspired against him to slay him.

01:037:019 And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh.

01:037:020 Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into
           some pit, and we will say, Some evil beast hath devoured him:
           and we shall see what will become of his dreams.

01:037:021 And Reuben heard it, and he delivered him out of their hands;
           and said, Let us not kill him.

01:037:022 And Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood, but cast him into
           this pit that is in the wilderness, and lay no hand upon him;
           that he might rid him out of their hands, to deliver him to
           his father again.

01:037:023 And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren,
           that they stript Joseph out of his coat, his coat of many
           colours that was on him;

01:037:024 And they took him, and cast him into a pit: and the pit was
           empty, there was no water in it.

01:037:025 And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes
           and looked, and, behold, a company of Ishmeelites came from
           Gilead with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh,
           going to carry it down to Egypt.

01:037:026 And Judah said unto his brethren, What profit is it if we slay
           our brother, and conceal his blood?

01:037:027 Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmeelites, and let not our
           hand be upon him; for he is our brother and our flesh. And his
           brethren were content.

01:037:028 Then there passed by Midianites merchantmen; and they drew and
           lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the
           Ishmeelites for twenty pieces of silver: and they brought
           Joseph into Egypt.

01:037:029 And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph was not
           in the pit; and he rent his clothes.

01:037:030 And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child is not;
           and I, whither shall I go?

01:037:031 And they took Joseph's coat, and killed a kid of the goats,
           and dipped the coat in the blood;

01:037:032 And they sent the coat of many colours, and they brought it to
           their father; and said, This have we found: know now whether
           it be thy son's coat or no.

01:037:033 And he knew it, and said, It is my son's coat; an evil beast
           hath devoured him; Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces.

01:037:034 And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins,
           and mourned for his son many days.

01:037:035 And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him;
           but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go
           down into the grave unto my son mourning. Thus his father wept
           for him.

01:037:036 And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an
           officer of Pharaoh's, and captain of the guard.

01:038:001 And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from
           his brethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose
           name was Hirah.

01:038:002 And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose
           name was Shuah; and he took her, and went in unto her.

01:038:003 And she conceived, and bare a son; and he called his name Er.

01:038:004 And she conceived again, and bare a son; and she called his
           name Onan.

01:038:005 And she yet again conceived, and bare a son; and called his
           name Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bare him.

01:038:006 And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, whose name was
           Tamar.

01:038:007 And Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the
           LORD; and the LORD slew him.

01:038:008 And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother's wife, and
           marry her, and raise up seed to thy brother.

01:038:009 And Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and it came to
           pass, when he went in unto his brother's wife, that he spilled
           it on the ground, lest that he should give seed to his
           brother.

01:038:010 And the thing which he did displeased the LORD: wherefore he
           slew him also.

01:038:011 Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter in law, Remain a widow
           at thy father's house, till Shelah my son be grown: for he
           said, Lest peradventure he die also, as his brethren did. And
           Tamar went and dwelt in her father's house.

01:038:012 And in process of time the daughter of Shuah Judah's wife
           died; and Judah was comforted, and went up unto his
           sheepshearers to Timnath, he and his friend Hirah the
           Adullamite.

01:038:013 And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold thy father in law goeth
           up to Timnath to shear his sheep.

01:038:014 And she put her widow's garments off from her, and covered her
           with a vail, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place,
           which is by the way to Timnath; for she saw that Shelah was
           grown, and she was not given unto him to wife.

01:038:015 When Judah saw her, he thought her to be an harlot; because
           she had covered her face.

01:038:016 And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray
           thee, let me come in unto thee; (for he knew not that she was
           his daughter in law.) And she said, What wilt thou give me,
           that thou mayest come in unto me?

01:038:017 And he said, I will send thee a kid from the flock. And she
           said, Wilt thou give me a pledge, till thou send it?

01:038:018 And he said, What pledge shall I give thee? And she said, Thy
           signet, and thy bracelets, and thy staff that is in thine
           hand. And he gave it her, and came in unto her, and she
           conceived by him.

01:038:019 And she arose, and went away, and laid by her vail from her,
           and put on the garments of her widowhood.

01:038:020 And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the
           Adullamite, to receive his pledge from the woman's hand: but
           he found her not.

01:038:021 Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where is the
           harlot, that was openly by the way side? And they said, There
           was no harlot in this place.

01:038:022 And he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and
           also the men of the place said, that there was no harlot in
           this place.

01:038:023 And Judah said, Let her take it to her, lest we be shamed:
           behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her.

01:038:024 And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told
           Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the
           harlot; and also, behold, she is with child by whoredom. And
           Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt.

01:038:025 When she was brought forth, she sent to her father in law,
           saying, By the man, whose these are, am I with child: and she
           said, Discern, I pray thee, whose are these, the signet, and
           bracelets, and staff.

01:038:026 And Judah acknowledged them, and said, She hath been more
           righteous than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my
           son. And he knew her again no more.

01:038:027 And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold,
           twins were in her womb.

01:038:028 And it came to pass, when she travailed, that the one put out
           his hand: and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a
           scarlet thread, saying, This came out first.

01:038:029 And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold,
           his brother came out: and she said, How hast thou broken
           forth? this breach be upon thee: therefore his name was called
           Pharez.

01:038:030 And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet
           thread upon his hand: and his name was called Zarah.

01:039:001 And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer
           of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of
           the hands of the Ishmeelites, which had brought him down
           thither.

01:039:002 And the LORD was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and
           he was in the house of his master the Egyptian.

01:039:003 And his master saw that the LORD was with him, and that the
           LORD made all that he did to prosper in his hand.

01:039:004 And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him: and he
           made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put
           into his hand.

01:039:005 And it came to pass from the time that he had made him
           overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that the LORD
           blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake; and the
           blessing of the LORD was upon all that he had in the house,
           and in the field.

01:039:006 And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand; and he knew not
           ought he had, save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was
           a goodly person, and well favoured.

01:039:007 And it came to pass after these things, that his master's wife
           cast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me.

01:039:008 But he refused, and said unto his master's wife, Behold, my
           master wotteth not what is with me in the house, and he hath
           committed all that he hath to my hand;

01:039:009 There is none greater in this house than I; neither hath he
           kept back any thing from me but thee, because thou art his
           wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against
           God?

01:039:010 And it came to pass, as she spake to Joseph day by day, that
           he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, or to be with her.

01:039:011 And it came to pass about this time, that Joseph went into the
           house to do his business; and there was none of the men of the
           house there within.

01:039:012 And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he
           left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out.

01:039:013 And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment
           in her hand, and was fled forth,

01:039:014 That she called unto the men of her house, and spake unto
           them, saying, See, he hath brought in an Hebrew unto us to
           mock us; he came in unto me to lie with me, and I cried with a
           loud voice:

01:039:015 And it came to pass, when he heard that I lifted up my voice
           and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled, and got
           him out.

01:039:016 And she laid up his garment by her, until his lord came home.

01:039:017 And she spake unto him according to these words, saying, The
           Hebrew servant, which thou hast brought unto us, came in unto
           me to mock me:

01:039:018 And it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that
           he left his garment with me, and fled out.

01:039:019 And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his
           wife, which she spake unto him, saying, After this manner did
           thy servant to me; that his wrath was kindled.

01:039:020 And Joseph's master took him, and put him into the prison, a
           place where the king's prisoners were bound: and he was there
           in the prison.

01:039:021 But the LORD was with Joseph, and shewed him mercy, and gave
           him favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison.

01:039:022 And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all
           the prisoners that were in the prison; and whatsoever they did
           there, he was the doer of it.

01:039:023 The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing that was
           under his hand; because the LORD was with him, and that which
           he did, the LORD made it to prosper.

01:040:001 And it came to pass after these things, that the butler of the
           king of Egypt and his baker had offended their lord the king
           of Egypt.

01:040:002 And Pharaoh was wroth against two of his officers, against the
           chief of the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers.

01:040:003 And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the
           guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph was bound.

01:040:004 And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he
           served them: and they continued a season in ward.

01:040:005 And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream in
           one night, each man according to the interpretation of his
           dream, the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, which
           were bound in the prison.

01:040:006 And Joseph came in unto them in the morning, and looked upon
           them, and, behold, they were sad.

01:040:007 And he asked Pharaoh's officers that were with him in the ward
           of his lord's house, saying, Wherefore look ye so sadly to
           day?

01:040:008 And they said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and there is
           no interpreter of it. And Joseph said unto them, Do not
           interpretations belong to God? tell me them, I pray you.

01:040:009 And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to
           him, In my dream, behold, a vine was before me;

01:040:010 And in the vine were three branches: and it was as though it
           budded, and her blossoms shot forth; and the clusters thereof
           brought forth ripe grapes:

01:040:011 And Pharaoh's cup was in my hand: and I took the grapes, and
           pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup into
           Pharaoh's hand.

01:040:012 And Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of it:
           The three branches are three days:

01:040:013 Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thine head, and
           restore thee unto thy place: and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh's
           cup into his hand, after the former manner when thou wast his
           butler.

01:040:014 But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and shew
           kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto
           Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house:

01:040:015 For indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews:
           and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into
           the dungeon.

01:040:016 When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he
           said unto Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, behold, I had
           three white baskets on my head:

01:040:017 And in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of
           bakemeats for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the
           basket upon my head.

01:040:018 And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation
           thereof: The three baskets are three days:

01:040:019 Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off
           thee, and shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat
           thy flesh from off thee.

01:040:020 And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh's
           birthday, that he made a feast unto all his servants: and he
           lifted up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker
           among his servants.

01:040:021 And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again;
           and he gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand:

01:040:022 But he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to
           them.

01:040:023 Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him.

01:041:001 And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh
           dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river.

01:041:002 And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well
           favoured kine and fatfleshed; and they fed in a meadow.

01:041:003 And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the
           river, ill favoured and leanfleshed; and stood by the other
           kine upon the brink of the river.

01:041:004 And the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven
           well favoured and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke.

01:041:005 And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven
           ears of corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good.

01:041:006 And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind
           sprung up after them.

01:041:007 And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears.
           And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream.

01:041:008 And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was
           troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of
           Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his
           dream; but there was none that could interpret them unto
           Pharaoh.

01:041:009 Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do
           remember my faults this day:

01:041:010 Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in ward in the
           captain of the guard's house, both me and the chief baker:

01:041:011 And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each
           man according to the interpretation of his dream.

01:041:012 And there was there with us a young man, an Hebrew, servant to
           the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted
           to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he did
           interpret.

01:041:013 And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he
           restored unto mine office, and him he hanged.

01:041:014 Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him
           hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved himself, and changed
           his raiment, and came in unto Pharaoh.

01:041:015 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and
           there is none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of
           thee, that thou canst understand a dream to interpret it.

01:041:016 And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God
           shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace.

01:041:017 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood
           upon the bank of the river:

01:041:018 And, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine,
           fatfleshed and well favoured; and they fed in a meadow:

01:041:019 And, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor and
           very ill favoured and leanfleshed, such as I never saw in all
           the land of Egypt for badness:

01:041:020 And the lean and the ill favoured kine did eat up the first
           seven fat kine:

01:041:021 And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that
           they had eaten them; but they were still ill favoured, as at
           the beginning. So I awoke.

01:041:022 And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one
           stalk, full and good:

01:041:023 And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, and blasted with the
           east wind, sprung up after them:

01:041:024 And the thin ears devoured the seven good ears: and I told
           this unto the magicians; but there was none that could declare
           it to me.

01:041:025 And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one: God
           hath shewed Pharaoh what he is about to do.

01:041:026 The seven good kine are seven years; and the seven good ears
           are seven years: the dream is one.

01:041:027 And the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after
           them are seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with
           the east wind shall be seven years of famine.

01:041:028 This is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God
           is about to do he sheweth unto Pharaoh.

01:041:029 Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all
           the land of Egypt:

01:041:030 And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and
           all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and
           the famine shall consume the land;

01:041:031 And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of
           that famine following; for it shall be very grievous.

01:041:032 And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; it is
           because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly
           bring it to pass.

01:041:033 Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise,
           and set him over the land of Egypt.

01:041:034 Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint officers over the
           land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the
           seven plenteous years.

01:041:035 And let them gather all the food of those good years that
           come, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them
           keep food in the cities.

01:041:036 And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven
           years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the
           land perish not through the famine.

01:041:037 And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes
           of all his servants.

01:041:038 And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find such a one as
           this is, a man in whom the Spirit of God is?

01:041:039 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shewed
           thee all this, there is none so discreet and wise as thou art:

01:041:040 Thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall
           all my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater
           than thou.

01:041:041 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all
           the land of Egypt.

01:041:042 And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon
           Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and
           put a gold chain about his neck;

01:041:043 And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had;
           and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he made him ruler
           over all the land of Egypt.

01:041:044 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without thee
           shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of
           Egypt.

01:041:045 And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphnathpaaneah; and he gave
           him to wife Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On.
           And Joseph went out over all the land of Egypt.

01:041:046 And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh
           king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of
           Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt.

01:041:047 And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by
           handfuls.

01:041:048 And he gathered up all the food of the seven years, which were
           in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the
           food of the field, which was round about every city, laid he
           up in the same.

01:041:049 And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much,
           until he left numbering; for it was without number.

01:041:050 And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine
           came, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On
           bare unto him.

01:041:051 And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For God,
           said he, hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father's
           house.

01:041:052 And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God hath
           caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.

01:041:053 And the seven years of plenteousness, that was in the land of
           Egypt, were ended.

01:041:054 And the seven years of dearth began to come, according as
           Joseph had said: and the dearth was in all lands; but in all
           the land of Egypt there was bread.

01:041:055 And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried
           to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians,
           Go unto Joseph; what he saith to you, do.

01:041:056 And the famine was over all the face of the earth: and Joseph
           opened all the storehouses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and
           the famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt.

01:041:057 And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy corn;
           because that the famine was so sore in all lands.

01:042:001 Now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob said
           unto his sons, Why do ye look one upon another?

01:042:002 And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is corn in Egypt:
           get you down thither, and buy for us from thence; that we may
           live, and not die.

01:042:003 And Joseph's ten brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt.

01:042:004 But Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob sent not with his
           brethren; for he said, Lest peradventure mischief befall him.

01:042:005 And the sons of Israel came to buy corn among those that came:
           for the famine was in the land of Canaan.

01:042:006 And Joseph was the governor over the land, and he it was that
           sold to all the people of the land: and Joseph's brethren
           came, and bowed down themselves before him with their faces to
           the earth.

01:042:007 And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made
           himself strange unto them, and spake roughly unto them; and he
           said unto them, Whence come ye? And they said, From the land
           of Canaan to buy food.

01:042:008 And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him.

01:042:009 And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and
           said unto them, Ye are spies; to see the nakedness of the land
           ye are come.

01:042:010 And they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy
           servants come.

01:042:011 We are all one man's sons; we are true men, thy servants are
           no spies.

01:042:012 And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the
           land ye are come.

01:042:013 And they said, Thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of
           one man in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest is
           this day with our father, and one is not.

01:042:014 And Joseph said unto them, That is it that I spake unto you,
           saying, Ye are spies:

01:042:015 Hereby ye shall be proved: By the life of Pharaoh ye shall not
           go forth hence, except your youngest brother come hither.

01:042:016 Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall
           be kept in prison, that your words may be proved, whether
           there be any truth in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh
           surely ye are spies.

01:042:017 And he put them all together into ward three days.

01:042:018 And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live;
           for I fear God:

01:042:019 If ye be true men, let one of your brethren be bound in the
           house of your prison: go ye, carry corn for the famine of your
           houses:

01:042:020 But bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall your words
           be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so.

01:042:021 And they said one to another, We are verily guilty concerning
           our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he
           besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress
           come upon us.

01:042:022 And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you,
           saying, Do not sin against the child; and ye would not hear?
           therefore, behold, also his blood is required.

01:042:023 And they knew not that Joseph understood them; for he spake
           unto them by an interpreter.

01:042:024 And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and returned
           to them again, and communed with them, and took from them
           Simeon, and bound him before their eyes.

01:042:025 Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and to
           restore every man's money into his sack, and to give them
           provision for the way: and thus did he unto them.

01:042:026 And they laded their asses with the corn, and departed thence.

01:042:027 And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender
           in the inn, he espied his money; for, behold, it was in his
           sack's mouth.

01:042:028 And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo,
           it is even in my sack: and their heart failed them, and they
           were afraid, saying one to another, What is this that God hath
           done unto us?

01:042:029 And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan,
           and told him all that befell unto them; saying,

01:042:030 The man, who is the lord of the land, spake roughly to us, and
           took us for spies of the country.

01:042:031 And we said unto him, We are true men; we are no spies:

01:042:032 We be twelve brethren, sons of our father; one is not, and the
           youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan.

01:042:033 And the man, the lord of the country, said unto us, Hereby
           shall I know that ye are true men; leave one of your brethren
           here with me, and take food for the famine of your households,
           and be gone:

01:042:034 And bring your youngest brother unto me: then shall I know
           that ye are no spies, but that ye are true men: so will I
           deliver you your brother, and ye shall traffick in the land.

01:042:035 And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold,
           every man's bundle of money was in his sack: and when both
           they and their father saw the bundles of money, they were
           afraid.

01:042:036 And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved of
           my children: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will
           take Benjamin away: all these things are against me.

01:042:037 And Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if
           I bring him not to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will
           bring him to thee again.

01:042:038 And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his
           brother is dead, and he is left alone: if mischief befall him
           by the way in the which ye go, then shall ye bring down my
           gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.

01:043:001 And the famine was sore in the land.

01:043:002 And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the corn which
           they had brought out of Egypt, their father said unto them, Go
           again, buy us a little food.

01:043:003 And Judah spake unto him, saying, The man did solemnly protest
           unto us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother
           be with you.

01:043:004 If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy
           thee food:

01:043:005 But if thou wilt not send him, we will not go down: for the
           man said unto us, Ye shall not see my face, except your
           brother be with you.

01:043:006 And Israel said, Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me, as to tell
           the man whether ye had yet a brother?

01:043:007 And they said, The man asked us straitly of our state, and of
           our kindred, saying, Is your father yet alive? have ye another
           brother? and we told him according to the tenor of these
           words: could we certainly know that he would say, Bring your
           brother down?

01:043:008 And Judah said unto Israel his father, Send the lad with me,
           and we will arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both
           we, and thou, and also our little ones.

01:043:009 I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him:
           if I bring him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then
           let me bear the blame for ever:

01:043:010 For except we had lingered, surely now we had returned this
           second time.

01:043:011 And their father Israel said unto them, If it must be so now,
           do this; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels,
           and carry down the man a present, a little balm, and a little
           honey, spices, and myrrh, nuts, and almonds:

01:043:012 And take double money in your hand; and the money that was
           brought again in the mouth of your sacks, carry it again in
           your hand; peradventure it was an oversight:

01:043:013 Take also your brother, and arise, go again unto the man:

01:043:014 And God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may
           send away your other brother, and Benjamin. If I be bereaved
           of my children, I am bereaved.

01:043:015 And the men took that present, and they took double money in
           their hand and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt,
           and stood before Joseph.

01:043:016 And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler
           of his house, Bring these men home, and slay, and make ready;
           for these men shall dine with me at noon.

01:043:017 And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men
           into Joseph's house.

01:043:018 And the men were afraid, because they were brought into
           Joseph's house; and they said, Because of the money that was
           returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in;
           that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and
           take us for bondmen, and our asses.

01:043:019 And they came near to the steward of Joseph's house, and they
           communed with him at the door of the house,

01:043:020 And said, O sir, we came indeed down at the first time to buy
           food:

01:043:021 And it came to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened
           our sacks, and, behold, every man's money was in the mouth of
           his sack, our money in full weight: and we have brought it
           again in our hand.

01:043:022 And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food:
           we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks.

01:043:023 And he said, Peace be to you, fear not: your God, and the God
           of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had
           your money. And he brought Simeon out unto them.

01:043:024 And the man brought the men into Joseph's house, and gave them
           water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses
           provender.

01:043:025 And they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon:
           for they heard that they should eat bread there.

01:043:026 And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which
           was in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him
           to the earth.

01:043:027 And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your father
           well, the old man of whom ye spake? Is he yet alive?

01:043:028 And they answered, Thy servant our father is in good health,
           he is yet alive. And they bowed down their heads, and made
           obeisance.

01:043:029 And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his
           mother's son, and said, Is this your younger brother, of whom
           ye spake unto me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my
           son.

01:043:030 And Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn upon his
           brother: and he sought where to weep; and he entered into his
           chamber, and wept there.

01:043:031 And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself,
           and said, Set on bread.

01:043:032 And they set on for him by himself, and for them by
           themselves, and for the Egyptians, which did eat with him, by
           themselves: because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the
           Hebrews; for that is an abomination unto the Egyptians.

01:043:033 And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his
           birthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the
           men marvelled one at another.

01:043:034 And he took and sent messes unto them from before him: but
           Benjamin's mess was five times so much as any of their's. And
           they drank, and were merry with him.

01:044:001 And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the
           men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put
           every man's money in his sack's mouth.

01:044:002 And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the
           youngest, and his corn money. And he did according to the word
           that Joseph had spoken.

01:044:003 As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they
           and their asses.

01:044:004 And when they were gone out of the city, and not yet far off,
           Joseph said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and
           when thou dost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye
           rewarded evil for good?

01:044:005 Is not this it in which my lord drinketh, and whereby indeed
           he divineth? ye have done evil in so doing.

01:044:006 And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these same words.

01:044:007 And they said unto him, Wherefore saith my lord these words?
           God forbid that thy servants should do according to this
           thing:

01:044:008 Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we
           brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then
           should we steal out of thy lord's house silver or gold?

01:044:009 With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, both let him die,
           and we also will be my lord's bondmen.

01:044:010 And he said, Now also let it be according unto your words: he
           with whom it is found shall be my servant; and ye shall be
           blameless.

01:044:011 Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground,
           and opened every man his sack.

01:044:012 And he searched, and began at the eldest, and left at the
           youngest: and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack.

01:044:013 Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and
           returned to the city.

01:044:014 And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house; for he was
           yet there: and they fell before him on the ground.

01:044:015 And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that ye have
           done? wot ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine?

01:044:016 And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we
           speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the
           iniquity of thy servants: behold, we are my lord's servants,
           both we, and he also with whom the cup is found.

01:044:017 And he said, God forbid that I should do so: but the man in
           whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant; and as
           for you, get you up in peace unto your father.

01:044:018 Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy
           servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let
           not thine anger burn against thy servant: for thou art even as
           Pharaoh.

01:044:019 My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a
           brother?

01:044:020 And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a
           child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead,
           and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him.

01:044:021 And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me,
           that I may set mine eyes upon him.

01:044:022 And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for
           if he should leave his father, his father would die.

01:044:023 And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest
           brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more.

01:044:024 And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my
           father, we told him the words of my lord.

01:044:025 And our father said, Go again, and buy us a little food.

01:044:026 And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be
           with us, then will we go down: for we may not see the man's
           face, except our youngest brother be with us.

01:044:027 And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife
           bare me two sons:

01:044:028 And the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in
           pieces; and I saw him not since:

01:044:029 And if ye take this also from me, and mischief befall him, ye
           shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.

01:044:030 Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the
           lad be not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the
           lad's life;

01:044:031 It shall come to pass, when he seeth that the lad is not with
           us, that he will die: and thy servants shall bring down the
           gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave.

01:044:032 For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father,
           saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then I shall bear the
           blame to my father for ever.

01:044:033 Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of
           the lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his
           brethren.

01:044:034 For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad be not with
           me? lest peradventure I see the evil that shall come on my
           father.

01:045:001 Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that
           stood by him; and he cried, Cause every man to go out from me.
           And there stood no man with him, while Joseph made himself
           known unto his brethren.

01:045:002 And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh
           heard.

01:045:003 And Joseph said unto his brethren, I am Joseph; doth my father
           yet live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they were
           troubled at his presence.

01:045:004 And Joseph said unto his brethren, Come near to me, I pray
           you. And they came near. And he said, I am Joseph your
           brother, whom ye sold into Egypt.

01:045:005 Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that
           ye sold me hither: for God did send me before you to preserve
           life.

01:045:006 For these two years hath the famine been in the land: and yet
           there are five years, in the which there shall neither be
           earing nor harvest.

01:045:007 And God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the
           earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance.

01:045:008 So now it was not you that sent me hither, but God: and he
           hath made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house,
           and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt.

01:045:009 Haste ye, and go up to my father, and say unto him, Thus saith
           thy son Joseph, God hath made me lord of all Egypt: come down
           unto me, tarry not:

01:045:010 And thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou shalt be
           near unto me, thou, and thy children, and thy children's
           children, and thy flocks, and thy herds, and all that thou
           hast:

01:045:011 And there will I nourish thee; for yet there are five years of
           famine; lest thou, and thy household, and all that thou hast,
           come to poverty.

01:045:012 And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother
           Benjamin, that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you.

01:045:013 And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of
           all that ye have seen; and ye shall haste and bring down my
           father hither.

01:045:014 And he fell upon his brother Benjamin's neck, and wept; and
           Benjamin wept upon his neck.

01:045:015 Moreover he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them: and
           after that his brethren talked with him.

01:045:016 And the fame thereof was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying,
           Joseph's brethren are come: and it pleased Pharaoh well, and
           his servants.

01:045:017 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Say unto thy brethren, This do
           ye; lade your beasts, and go, get you unto the land of Canaan;

01:045:018 And take your father and your households, and come unto me:
           and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye
           shall eat the fat of the land.

01:045:019 Now thou art commanded, this do ye; take you wagons out of the
           land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and
           bring your father, and come.

01:045:020 Also regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land of
           Egypt is your's.

01:045:021 And the children of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them
           wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them
           provision for the way.

01:045:022 To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but to
           Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver, and five
           changes of raiment.

01:045:023 And to his father he sent after this manner; ten asses laden
           with the good things of Egypt, and ten she asses laden with
           corn and bread and meat for his father by the way.

01:045:024 So he sent his brethren away, and they departed: and he said
           unto them, See that ye fall not out by the way.

01:045:025 And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of
           Canaan unto Jacob their father,

01:045:026 And told him, saying, Joseph is yet alive, and he is governor
           over all the land of Egypt. And Jacob's heart fainted, for he
           believed them not.

01:045:027 And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said
           unto them: and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to
           carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived:

01:045:028 And Israel said, It is enough; Joseph my son is yet alive: I
           will go and see him before I die.

01:046:001 And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to
           Beersheba, and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father
           Isaac.

01:046:002 And God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night, and
           said, Jacob, Jacob. And he said, Here am I.

01:046:003 And he said, I am God, the God of thy father: fear not to go
           down into Egypt; for I will there make of thee a great nation:

01:046:004 I will go down with thee into Egypt; and I will also surely
           bring thee up again: and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine
           eyes.

01:046:005 And Jacob rose up from Beersheba: and the sons of Israel
           carried Jacob their father, and their little ones, and their
           wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him.

01:046:006 And they took their cattle, and their goods, which they had
           gotten in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob, and
           all his seed with him:

01:046:007 His sons, and his sons' sons with him, his daughters, and his
           sons' daughters, and all his seed brought he with him into
           Egypt.

01:046:008 And these are the names of the children of Israel, which came
           into Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacob's firstborn.

01:046:009 And the sons of Reuben; Hanoch, and Phallu, and Hezron, and
           Carmi.

01:046:010 And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and
           Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman.

01:046:011 And the sons of Levi; Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.

01:046:012 And the sons of Judah; Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Pharez,
           and Zarah: but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. And the
           sons of Pharez were Hezron and Hamul.

01:046:013 And the sons of Issachar; Tola, and Phuvah, and Job, and
           Shimron.

01:046:014 And the sons of Zebulun; Sered, and Elon, and Jahleel.

01:046:015 These be the sons of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob in
           Padanaram, with his daughter Dinah: all the souls of his sons
           and his daughters were thirty and three.

01:046:016 And the sons of Gad; Ziphion, and Haggi, Shuni, and Ezbon,
           Eri, and Arodi, and Areli.

01:046:017 And the sons of Asher; Jimnah, and Ishuah, and Isui, and
           Beriah, and Serah their sister: and the sons of Beriah; Heber,
           and Malchiel.

01:046:018 These are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah his
           daughter, and these she bare unto Jacob, even sixteen souls.

01:046:019 The sons of Rachel Jacob's wife; Joseph, and Benjamin.

01:046:020 And unto Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and
           Ephraim, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On
           bare unto him.

01:046:021 And the sons of Benjamin were Belah, and Becher, and Ashbel,
           Gera, and Naaman, Ehi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard.

01:046:022 These are the sons of Rachel, which were born to Jacob: all
           the souls were fourteen.

01:046:023 And the sons of Dan; Hushim.

01:046:024 And the sons of Naphtali; Jahzeel, and Guni, and Jezer, and
           Shillem.

01:046:025 These are the sons of Bilhah, which Laban gave unto Rachel his
           daughter, and she bare these unto Jacob: all the souls were
           seven.

01:046:026 All the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt, which came out
           of his loins, besides Jacob's sons' wives, all the souls were
           threescore and six;

01:046:027 And the sons of Joseph, which were born him in Egypt, were two
           souls: all the souls of the house of Jacob, which came into
           Egypt, were threescore and ten.

01:046:028 And he sent Judah before him unto Joseph, to direct his face
           unto Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen.

01:046:029 And Joseph made ready his chariot, and went up to meet Israel
           his father, to Goshen, and presented himself unto him; and he
           fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while.

01:046:030 And Israel said unto Joseph, Now let me die, since I have seen
           thy face, because thou art yet alive.

01:046:031 And Joseph said unto his brethren, and unto his father's
           house, I will go up, and shew Pharaoh, and say unto him, My
           brethren, and my father's house, which were in the land of
           Canaan, are come unto me;

01:046:032 And the men are shepherds, for their trade hath been to feed
           cattle; and they have brought their flocks, and their herds,
           and all that they have.

01:046:033 And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh shall call you, and
           shall say, What is your occupation?

01:046:034 That ye shall say, Thy servants' trade hath been about cattle
           from our youth even until now, both we, and also our fathers:
           that ye may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd is
           an abomination unto the Egyptians.

01:047:001 Then Joseph came and told Pharaoh, and said, My father and my
           brethren, and their flocks, and their herds, and all that they
           have, are come out of the land of Canaan; and, behold, they
           are in the land of Goshen.

01:047:002 And he took some of his brethren, even five men, and presented
           them unto Pharaoh.

01:047:003 And Pharaoh said unto his brethren, What is your occupation?
           And they said unto Pharaoh, Thy servants are shepherds, both
           we, and also our fathers.

01:047:004 They said morever unto Pharaoh, For to sojourn in the land are
           we come; for thy servants have no pasture for their flocks;
           for the famine is sore in the land of Canaan: now therefore,
           we pray thee, let thy servants dwell in the land of Goshen.

01:047:005 And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph, saying, Thy father and thy
           brethren are come unto thee:

01:047:006 The land of Egypt is before thee; in the best of the land make
           thy father and brethren to dwell; in the land of Goshen let
           them dwell: and if thou knowest any men of activity among
           them, then make them rulers over my cattle.

01:047:007 And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him before
           Pharaoh: and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.

01:047:008 And Pharaoh said unto Jacob, How old art thou?

01:047:009 And Jacob said unto Pharaoh, The days of the years of my
           pilgrimage are an hundred and thirty years: few and evil have
           the days of the years of my life been, and have not attained
           unto the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the
           days of their pilgrimage.

01:047:010 And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from before Pharaoh.

01:047:011 And Joseph placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a
           possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in
           the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.

01:047:012 And Joseph nourished his father, and his brethren, and all his
           father's household, with bread, according to their families.

01:047:013 And there was no bread in all the land; for the famine was
           very sore, so that the land of Egypt and all the land of
           Canaan fainted by reason of the famine.

01:047:014 And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the
           land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn which
           they bought: and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's
           house.

01:047:015 And when money failed in the land of Egypt, and in the land of
           Canaan, all the Egyptians came unto Joseph, and said, Give us
           bread: for why should we die in thy presence? for the money
           faileth.

01:047:016 And Joseph said, Give your cattle; and I will give you for
           your cattle, if money fail.

01:047:017 And they brought their cattle unto Joseph: and Joseph gave
           them bread in exchange for horses, and for the flocks, and for
           the cattle of the herds, and for the asses: and he fed them
           with bread for all their cattle for that year.

01:047:018 When that year was ended, they came unto him the second year,
           and said unto him, We will not hide it from my lord, how that
           our money is spent; my lord also hath our herds of cattle;
           there is not ought left in the sight of my lord, but our
           bodies, and our lands:

01:047:019 Wherefore shall we die before thine eyes, both we and our
           land? buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will
           be servants unto Pharaoh: and give us seed, that we may live,
           and not die, that the land be not desolate.

01:047:020 And Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the
           Egyptians sold every man his field, because the famine
           prevailed over them: so the land became Pharaoh's.

01:047:021 And as for the people, he removed them to cities from one end
           of the borders of Egypt even to the other end thereof.

01:047:022 Only the land of the priests bought he not; for the priests
           had a portion assigned them of Pharaoh, and did eat their
           portion which Pharaoh gave them: wherefore they sold not their
           lands.

01:047:023 Then Joseph said unto the people, Behold, I have bought you
           this day and your land for Pharaoh: lo, here is seed for you,
           and ye shall sow the land.

01:047:024 And it shall come to pass in the increase, that ye shall give
           the fifth part unto Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own,
           for seed of the field, and for your food, and for them of your
           households, and for food for your little ones.

01:047:025 And they said, Thou hast saved our lives: let us find grace in
           the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh's servants.

01:047:026 And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt unto this day,
           that Pharaoh should have the fifth part, except the land of
           the priests only, which became not Pharaoh's.

01:047:027 And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the country of
           Goshen; and they had possessions therein, and grew, and
           multiplied exceedingly.

01:047:028 And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years: so the
           whole age of Jacob was an hundred forty and seven years.

01:047:029 And the time drew nigh that Israel must die: and he called his
           son Joseph, and said unto him, If now I have found grace in
           thy sight, put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and deal
           kindly and truly with me; bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt:

01:047:030 But I will lie with my fathers, and thou shalt carry me out of
           Egypt, and bury me in their buryingplace. And he said, I will
           do as thou hast said.

01:047:031 And he said, Swear unto me. And he sware unto him. And Israel
           bowed himself upon the bed's head.

01:048:001 And it came to pass after these things, that one told Joseph,
           Behold, thy father is sick: and he took with him his two sons,
           Manasseh and Ephraim.

01:048:002 And one told Jacob, and said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh
           unto thee: and Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the
           bed.

01:048:003 And Jacob said unto Joseph, God Almighty appeared unto me at
           Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,

01:048:004 And said unto me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and
           multiply thee, and I will make of thee a multitude of people;
           and will give this land to thy seed after thee for an
           everlasting possession.

01:048:005 And now thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, which were born
           unto thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into
           Egypt, are mine; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine.

01:048:006 And thy issue, which thou begettest after them, shall be
           thine, and shall be called after the name of their brethren in
           their inheritance.

01:048:007 And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in
           the land of Canaan in the way, when yet there was but a little
           way to come unto Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way of
           Ephrath; the same is Bethlehem.

01:048:008 And Israel beheld Joseph's sons, and said, Who are these?

01:048:009 And Joseph said unto his father, They are my sons, whom God
           hath given me in this place. And he said, Bring them, I pray
           thee, unto me, and I will bless them.

01:048:010 Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not
           see. And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them,
           and embraced them.

01:048:011 And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy
           face: and, lo, God hath shewed me also thy seed.

01:048:012 And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he
           bowed himself with his face to the earth.

01:048:013 And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward
           Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward
           Israel's right hand, and brought them near unto him.

01:048:014 And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon
           Ephraim's head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon
           Manasseh's head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh was
           the firstborn.

01:048:015 And he blessed Joseph, and said, God, before whom my fathers
           Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God which fed me all my life
           long unto this day,

01:048:016 The Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and
           let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers
           Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the
           midst of the earth.

01:048:017 And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon
           the head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his
           father's hand, to remove it from Ephraim's head unto
           Manasseh's head.

01:048:018 And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father: for this
           is the firstborn; put thy right hand upon his head.

01:048:019 And his father refused, and said, I know it, my son, I know
           it: he also shall become a people, and he also shall be great:
           but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he, and
           his seed shall become a multitude of nations.

01:048:020 And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee shall Israel
           bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and
           he set Ephraim before Manasseh.

01:048:021 And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die: but God shall be
           with you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers.

01:048:022 Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren,
           which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and
           with my bow.

01:049:001 And Jacob called unto his sons, and said, Gather yourselves
           together, that I may tell you that which shall befall you in
           the last days.

01:049:002 Gather yourselves together, and hear, ye sons of Jacob; and
           hearken unto Israel your father.

01:049:003 Reuben, thou art my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of
           my strength, the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of
           power:

01:049:004 Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel; because thou wentest
           up to thy father's bed; then defiledst thou it: he went up to
           my couch.

01:049:005 Simeon and Levi are brethren; instruments of cruelty are in
           their habitations.

01:049:006 O my soul, come not thou into their secret; unto their
           assembly, mine honour, be not thou united: for in their anger
           they slew a man, and in their selfwill they digged down a
           wall.

01:049:007 Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath, for
           it was cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in
           Israel.

01:049:008 Judah, thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise: thy hand
           shall be in the neck of thine enemies; thy father's children
           shall bow down before thee.

01:049:009 Judah is a lion's whelp: from the prey, my son, thou art gone
           up: he stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion;
           who shall rouse him up?

01:049:010 The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from
           between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him shall the
           gathering of the people be.

01:049:011 Binding his foal unto the vine, and his ass's colt unto the
           choice vine; he washed his garments in wine, and his clothes
           in the blood of grapes:

01:049:012 His eyes shall be red with wine, and his teeth white with
           milk.

01:049:013 Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; and he shall be
           for an haven of ships; and his border shall be unto Zidon.

01:049:014 Issachar is a strong ass couching down between two burdens:

01:049:015 And he saw that rest was good, and the land that it was
           pleasant; and bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a servant
           unto tribute.

01:049:016 Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel.

01:049:017 Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path, that
           biteth the horse heels, so that his rider shall fall backward.

01:049:018 I have waited for thy salvation, O LORD.

01:049:019 Gad, a troop shall overcome him: but he shall overcome at the
           last.

01:049:020 Out of Asher his bread shall be fat, and he shall yield royal
           dainties.

01:049:021 Naphtali is a hind let loose: he giveth goodly words.

01:049:022 Joseph is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a well;
           whose branches run over the wall:

01:049:023 The archers have sorely grieved him, and shot at him, and
           hated him:

01:049:024 But his bow abode in strength, and the arms of his hands were
           made strong by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob; (from
           thence is the shepherd, the stone of Israel:)

01:049:025 Even by the God of thy father, who shall help thee; and by the
           Almighty, who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above,
           blessings of the deep that lieth under, blessings of the
           breasts, and of the womb:

01:049:026 The blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings
           of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting
           hills: they shall be on the head of Joseph, and on the crown
           of the head of him that was separate from his brethren.

01:049:027 Benjamin shall ravin as a wolf: in the morning he shall devour
           the prey, and at night he shall divide the spoil.

01:049:028 All these are the twelve tribes of Israel: and this is it that
           their father spake unto them, and blessed them; every one
           according to his blessing he blessed them.

01:049:029 And he charged them, and said unto them, I am to be gathered
           unto my people: bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in
           the field of Ephron the Hittite,

01:049:030 In the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before
           Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the
           field of Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a
           buryingplace.

01:049:031 There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they
           buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah.

01:049:032 The purchase of the field and of the cave that is therein was
           from the children of Heth.

01:049:033 And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he
           gathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost,
           and was gathered unto his people.

01:050:001 And Joseph fell upon his father's face, and wept upon him, and
           kissed him.

01:050:002 And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his
           father: and the physicians embalmed Israel.

01:050:003 And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled
           the days of those which are embalmed: and the Egyptians
           mourned for him threescore and ten days.

01:050:004 And when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spake unto
           the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found grace in
           your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,

01:050:005 My father made me swear, saying, Lo, I die: in my grave which
           I have digged for me in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou
           bury me. Now therefore let me go up, I pray thee, and bury my
           father, and I will come again.

01:050:006 And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as he
           made thee swear.

01:050:007 And Joseph went up to bury his father: and with him went up
           all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all
           the elders of the land of Egypt,

01:050:008 And all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his
           father's house: only their little ones, and their flocks, and
           their herds, they left in the land of Goshen.

01:050:009 And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it
           was a very great company.

01:050:010 And they came to the threshingfloor of Atad, which is beyond
           Jordan, and there they mourned with a great and very sore
           lamentation: and he made a mourning for his father seven days.

01:050:011 And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the
           mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This is a grievous
           mourning to the Egyptians: wherefore the name of it was called
           Abelmizraim, which is beyond Jordan.

01:050:012 And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them:

01:050:013 For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried
           him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham
           bought with the field for a possession of a buryingplace of
           Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre.

01:050:014 And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren, and all
           that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried
           his father.

01:050:015 And when Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead,
           they said, Joseph will peradventure hate us, and will
           certainly requite us all the evil which we did unto him.

01:050:016 And they sent a messenger unto Joseph, saying, Thy father did
           command before he died, saying,

01:050:017 So shall ye say unto Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the
           trespass of thy brethren, and their sin; for they did unto
           thee evil: and now, we pray thee, forgive the trespass of the
           servants of the God of thy father. And Joseph wept when they
           spake unto him.

01:050:018 And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; and
           they said, Behold, we be thy servants.

01:050:019 And Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for am I in the place of
           God?

01:050:020 But as for you, ye thought evil against me; but God meant it
           unto good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much
           people alive.

01:050:021 Now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your little
           ones. And he comforted them, and spake kindly unto them.

01:050:022 And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father's house: and
           Joseph lived an hundred and ten years.

01:050:023 And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third generation: the
           children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were brought up
           upon Joseph's knees.

01:050:024 And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die: and God will surely
           visit you, and bring you out of this land unto the land which
           he sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.

01:050:025 And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God
           will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from
           hence.

01:050:026 So Joseph died, being an hundred and ten years old: and they
           embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.

Book 02        Exodus

02:001:001 Now these are the names of the children of Israel, which came
           into Egypt; every man and his household came with Jacob.

02:001:002 Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,

02:001:003 Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,

02:001:004 Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher.

02:001:005 And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were
           seventy souls: for Joseph was in Egypt already.

02:001:006 And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that
           generation.

02:001:007 And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased
           abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and
           the land was filled with them.

02:001:008 Now there arose up a new king over Egypt, which knew not
           Joseph.

02:001:009 And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the
           children of Israel are more and mightier than we:

02:001:010 Come on, let us deal wisely with them; lest they multiply, and
           it come to pass, that, when there falleth out any war, they
           join also unto our enemies, and fight against us, and so get
           them up out of the land.

02:001:011 Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them
           with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure
           cities, Pithom and Raamses.

02:001:012 But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and
           grew. And they were grieved because of the children of Israel.

02:001:013 And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with
           rigour:

02:001:014 And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in morter,
           and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all
           their service, wherein they made them serve, was with rigour.

02:001:015 And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which
           the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other
           Puah:

02:001:016 And he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew
           women, and see them upon the stools; if it be a son, then ye
           shall kill him: but if it be a daughter, then she shall live.

02:001:017 But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt
           commanded them, but saved the men children alive.

02:001:018 And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto
           them, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men
           children alive?

02:001:019 And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women
           are not as the Egyptian women; for they are lively, and are
           delivered ere the midwives come in unto them.

02:001:020 Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people
           multiplied, and waxed very mighty.

02:001:021 And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he
           made them houses.

02:001:022 And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is
           born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall
           save alive.

02:002:001 And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took to wife a
           daughter of Levi.

02:002:002 And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him
           that he was a goodly child, she hid him three months.

02:002:003 And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an
           ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and
           put the child therein; and she laid it in the flags by the
           river's brink.

02:002:004 And his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to
           him.

02:002:005 And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself at the
           river; and her maidens walked along by the river's side; and
           when she saw the ark among the flags, she sent her maid to
           fetch it.

02:002:006 And when she had opened it, she saw the child: and, behold,
           the babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This
           is one of the Hebrews' children.

02:002:007 Then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and
           call to thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse
           the child for thee?

02:002:008 And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and
           called the child's mother.

02:002:009 And Pharaoh's daughter said unto her, Take this child away,
           and nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages. And the
           women took the child, and nursed it.

02:002:010 And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh's
           daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name
           Moses: and she said, Because I drew him out of the water.

02:002:011 And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that
           he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens:
           and he spied an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his
           brethren.

02:002:012 And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that
           there was no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the
           sand.

02:002:013 And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the
           Hebrews strove together: and he said to him that did the
           wrong, Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow?

02:002:014 And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us?
           intendest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And
           Moses feared, and said, Surely this thing is known.

02:002:015 Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses.
           But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land
           of Midian: and he sat down by a well.

02:002:016 Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came
           and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father's
           flock.

02:002:017 And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood up
           and helped them, and watered their flock.

02:002:018 And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it
           that ye are come so soon to day?

02:002:019 And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the
           shepherds, and also drew water enough for us, and watered the
           flock.

02:002:020 And he said unto his daughters, And where is he? why is it
           that ye have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread.

02:002:021 And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses
           Zipporah his daughter.

02:002:022 And she bare him a son, and he called his name Gershom: for he
           said, I have been a stranger in a strange land.

02:002:023 And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt
           died: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the
           bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up unto God by
           reason of the bondage.

02:002:024 And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant
           with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.

02:002:025 And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God had
           respect unto them.

02:003:001 Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father in law, the
           priest of Midian: and he led the flock to the backside of the
           desert, and came to the mountain of God, even to Horeb.

02:003:002 And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him in a flame of fire
           out of the midst of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the
           bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed.

02:003:003 And Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this great
           sight, why the bush is not burnt.

02:003:004 And when the LORD saw that he turned aside to see, God called
           unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses.
           And he said, Here am I.

02:003:005 And he said, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off
           thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.

02:003:006 Moreover he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of
           Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid
           his face; for he was afraid to look upon God.

02:003:007 And the LORD said, I have surely seen the affliction of my
           people which are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason
           of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows;

02:003:008 And I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the
           Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a good
           land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey;
           unto the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the
           Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the
           Jebusites.

02:003:009 Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is
           come unto me: and I have also seen the oppression wherewith
           the Egyptians oppress them.

02:003:010 Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that
           thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out
           of Egypt.

02:003:011 And Moses said unto God, Who am I, that I should go unto
           Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel
           out of Egypt?

02:003:012 And he said, Certainly I will be with thee; and this shall be
           a token unto thee, that I have sent thee: When thou hast
           brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon
           this mountain.

02:003:013 And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children
           of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers
           hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his
           name? what shall I say unto them?

02:003:014 And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus
           shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me
           unto you.

02:003:015 And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the
           children of Israel, the LORD God of your fathers, the God of
           Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me
           unto you: this is my name for ever, and this is my memorial
           unto all generations.

02:003:016 Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto
           them, The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of
           Isaac, and of Jacob, appeared unto me, saying, I have surely
           visited you, and seen that which is done to you in Egypt:

02:003:017 And I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of
           Egypt unto the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and
           the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the
           Jebusites, unto a land flowing with milk and honey.

02:003:018 And they shall hearken to thy voice: and thou shalt come, thou
           and the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and ye shall
           say unto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath met with us:
           and now let us go, we beseech thee, three days' journey into
           the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God.

02:003:019 And I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go, no,
           not by a mighty hand.

02:003:020 And I will stretch out my hand, and smite Egypt with all my
           wonders which I will do in the midst thereof: and after that
           he will let you go.

02:003:021 And I will give this people favour in the sight of the
           Egyptians: and it shall come to pass, that, when ye go, ye
           shall not go empty.

02:003:022 But every woman shall borrow of her neighbour, and of her that
           sojourneth in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold,
           and raiment: and ye shall put them upon your sons, and upon
           your daughters; and ye shall spoil the Egyptians.

02:004:001 And Moses answered and said, But, behold, they will not
           believe me, nor hearken unto my voice: for they will say, The
           LORD hath not appeared unto thee.

02:004:002 And the LORD said unto him, What is that in thine hand? And he
           said, A rod.

02:004:003 And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the
           ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before
           it.

02:004:004 And the LORD said unto Moses, Put forth thine hand, and take
           it by the tail. And he put forth his hand, and caught it, and
           it became a rod in his hand:

02:004:005 That they may believe that the LORD God of their fathers, the
           God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath
           appeared unto thee.

02:004:006 And the LORD said furthermore unto him, Put now thine hand
           into thy bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom: and when
           he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous as snow.

02:004:007 And he said, Put thine hand into thy bosom again. And he put
           his hand into his bosom again; and plucked it out of his
           bosom, and, behold, it was turned again as his other flesh.

02:004:008 And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee,
           neither hearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will
           believe the voice of the latter sign.

02:004:009 And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe also these
           two signs, neither hearken unto thy voice, that thou shalt
           take of the water of the river, and pour it upon the dry land:
           and the water which thou takest out of the river shall become
           blood upon the dry land.

02:004:010 And Moses said unto the LORD, O my LORD, I am not eloquent,
           neither heretofore, nor since thou hast spoken unto thy
           servant: but I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue.

02:004:011 And the LORD said unto him, Who hath made man's mouth? or who
           maketh the dumb, or deaf, or the seeing, or the blind? have
           not I the LORD?

02:004:012 Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee
           what thou shalt say.

02:004:013 And he said, O my LORD, send, I pray thee, by the hand of him
           whom thou wilt send.

02:004:014 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Moses, and he
           said, Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother? I know that he can
           speak well. And also, behold, he cometh forth to meet thee:
           and when he seeth thee, he will be glad in his heart.

02:004:015 And thou shalt speak unto him, and put words in his mouth: and
           I will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach
           you what ye shall do.

02:004:016 And he shall be thy spokesman unto the people: and he shall
           be, even he shall be to thee instead of a mouth, and thou
           shalt be to him instead of God.

02:004:017 And thou shalt take this rod in thine hand, wherewith thou
           shalt do signs.

02:004:018 And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father in law, and
           said unto him, Let me go, I pray thee, and return unto my
           brethren which are in Egypt, and see whether they be yet
           alive. And Jethro said to Moses, Go in peace.

02:004:019 And the LORD said unto Moses in Midian, Go, return into Egypt:
           for all the men are dead which sought thy life.

02:004:020 And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them upon an
           ass, and he returned to the land of Egypt: and Moses took the
           rod of God in his hand.

02:004:021 And the LORD said unto Moses, When thou goest to return into
           Egypt, see that thou do all those wonders before Pharaoh,
           which I have put in thine hand: but I will harden his heart,
           that he shall not let the people go.

02:004:022 And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, Thus saith the LORD, Israel
           is my son, even my firstborn:

02:004:023 And I say unto thee, Let my son go, that he may serve me: and
           if thou refuse to let him go, behold, I will slay thy son,
           even thy firstborn.

02:004:024 And it came to pass by the way in the inn, that the LORD met
           him, and sought to kill him.

02:004:025 Then Zipporah took a sharp stone, and cut off the foreskin of
           her son, and cast it at his feet, and said, Surely a bloody
           husband art thou to me.

02:004:026 So he let him go: then she said, A bloody husband thou art,
           because of the circumcision.

02:004:027 And the LORD said to Aaron, Go into the wilderness to meet
           Moses. And he went, and met him in the mount of God, and
           kissed him.

02:004:028 And Moses told Aaron all the words of the LORD who had sent
           him, and all the signs which he had commanded him.

02:004:029 And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders
           of the children of Israel:

02:004:030 And Aaron spake all the words which the LORD had spoken unto
           Moses, and did the signs in the sight of the people.

02:004:031 And the people believed: and when they heard that the LORD had
           visited the children of Israel, and that he had looked upon
           their affliction, then they bowed their heads and worshipped.

02:005:001 And afterward Moses and Aaron went in, and told Pharaoh, Thus
           saith the LORD God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may
           hold a feast unto me in the wilderness.

02:005:002 And Pharaoh said, Who is the LORD, that I should obey his
           voice to let Israel go? I know not the LORD, neither will I
           let Israel go.

02:005:003 And they said, The God of the Hebrews hath met with us: let us
           go, we pray thee, three days' journey into the desert, and
           sacrifice unto the LORD our God; lest he fall upon us with
           pestilence, or with the sword.

02:005:004 And the king of Egypt said unto them, Wherefore do ye, Moses
           and Aaron, let the people from their works? get you unto your
           burdens.

02:005:005 And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land now are many,
           and ye make them rest from their burdens.

02:005:006 And Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the
           people, and their officers, saying,

02:005:007 Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as
           heretofore: let them go and gather straw for themselves.

02:005:008 And the tale of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye
           shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish ought thereof: for
           they be idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and
           sacrifice to our God.

02:005:009 Let there more work be laid upon the men, that they may labour
           therein; and let them not regard vain words.

02:005:010 And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their
           officers, and they spake to the people, saying, Thus saith
           Pharaoh, I will not give you straw.

02:005:011 Go ye, get you straw where ye can find it: yet not ought of
           your work shall be diminished.

02:005:012 So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of
           Egypt to gather stubble instead of straw.

02:005:013 And the taskmasters hasted them, saying, Fulfil your works,
           your daily tasks, as when there was straw.

02:005:014 And the officers of the children of Israel, which Pharaoh's
           taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and demanded,
           Wherefore have ye not fulfilled your task in making brick both
           yesterday and to day, as heretofore?

02:005:015 Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried
           unto Pharaoh, saying, Wherefore dealest thou thus with thy
           servants?

02:005:016 There is no straw given unto thy servants, and they say to us,
           Make brick: and, behold, thy servants are beaten; but the
           fault is in thine own people.

02:005:017 But he said, Ye are idle, ye are idle: therefore ye say, Let
           us go and do sacrifice to the LORD.

02:005:018 Go therefore now, and work; for there shall no straw be given
           you, yet shall ye deliver the tale of bricks.

02:005:019 And the officers of the children of Israel did see that they
           were in evil case, after it was said, Ye shall not minish
           ought from your bricks of your daily task.

02:005:020 And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they
           came forth from Pharaoh:

02:005:021 And they said unto them, The LORD look upon you, and judge;
           because ye have made our savour to be abhorred in the eyes of
           Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in
           their hand to slay us.

02:005:022 And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, LORD, wherefore
           hast thou so evil entreated this people? why is it that thou
           hast sent me?

02:005:023 For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath done
           evil to this people; neither hast thou delivered thy people at
           all.

02:006:001 Then the LORD said unto Moses, Now shalt thou see what I will
           do to Pharaoh: for with a strong hand shall he let them go,
           and with a strong hand shall he drive them out of his land.

02:006:002 And God spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I am the LORD:

02:006:003 And I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by
           the name of God Almighty, but by my name JEHOVAH was I not
           known to them.

02:006:004 And I have also established my covenant with them, to give
           them the land of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage, wherein
           they were strangers.

02:006:005 And I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel,
           whom the Egyptians keep in bondage; and I have remembered my
           covenant.

02:006:006 Wherefore say unto the children of Israel, I am the LORD, and
           I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians,
           and I will rid you out of their bondage, and I will redeem you
           with a stretched out arm, and with great judgments:

02:006:007 And I will take you to me for a people, and I will be to you a
           God: and ye shall know that I am the LORD your God, which
           bringeth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians.

02:006:008 And I will bring you in unto the land, concerning the which I
           did swear to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I
           will give it you for an heritage: I am the LORD.

02:006:009 And Moses spake so unto the children of Israel: but they
           hearkened not unto Moses for anguish of spirit, and for cruel
           bondage.

02:006:010 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

02:006:011 Go in, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the
           children of Israel go out of his land.

02:006:012 And Moses spake before the LORD, saying, Behold, the children
           of Israel have not hearkened unto me; how then shall Pharaoh
           hear me, who am of uncircumcised lips?

02:006:013 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, and gave them a
           charge unto the children of Israel, and unto Pharaoh king of
           Egypt, to bring the children of Israel out of the land of
           Egypt.

02:006:014 These be the heads of their fathers' houses: The sons of
           Reuben the firstborn of Israel; Hanoch, and Pallu, Hezron, and
           Carmi: these be the families of Reuben.

02:006:015 And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and
           Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman:
           these are the families of Simeon.

02:006:016 And these are the names of the sons of Levi according to their
           generations; Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari: and the years of
           the life of Levi were an hundred thirty and seven years.

02:006:017 The sons of Gershon; Libni, and Shimi, according to their
           families.

02:006:018 And the sons of Kohath; Amram, and Izhar, and Hebron, and
           Uzziel: and the years of the life of Kohath were an hundred
           thirty and three years.

02:006:019 And the sons of Merari; Mahali and Mushi: these are the
           families of Levi according to their generations.

02:006:020 And Amram took him Jochebed his father's sister to wife; and
           she bare him Aaron and Moses: and the years of the life of
           Amram were an hundred and thirty and seven years.

02:006:021 And the sons of Izhar; Korah, and Nepheg, and Zichri.

02:006:022 And the sons of Uzziel; Mishael, and Elzaphan, and Zithri.

02:006:023 And Aaron took him Elisheba, daughter of Amminadab, sister of
           Naashon, to wife; and she bare him Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar,
           and Ithamar.

02:006:024 And the sons of Korah; Assir, and Elkanah, and Abiasaph: these
           are the families of the Korhites.

02:006:025 And Eleazar Aaron's son took him one of the daughters of
           Putiel to wife; and she bare him Phinehas: these are the heads
           of the fathers of the Levites according to their families.

02:006:026 These are that Aaron and Moses, to whom the LORD said, Bring
           out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to
           their armies.

02:006:027 These are they which spake to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring
           out the children of Israel from Egypt: these are that Moses
           and Aaron.

02:006:028 And it came to pass on the day when the LORD spake unto Moses
           in the land of Egypt,

02:006:029 That the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, I am the LORD: speak
           thou unto Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I say unto thee.

02:006:030 And Moses said before the LORD, Behold, I am of uncircumcised
           lips, and how shall Pharaoh hearken unto me?

02:007:001 And the LORD said unto Moses, See, I have made thee a god to
           Pharaoh: and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet.

02:007:002 Thou shalt speak all that I command thee: and Aaron thy
           brother shall speak unto Pharaoh, that he send the children of
           Israel out of his land.

02:007:003 And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and multiply my signs and
           my wonders in the land of Egypt.

02:007:004 But Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you, that I may lay my hand
           upon Egypt, and bring forth mine armies, and my people the
           children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great
           judgments.

02:007:005 And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I
           stretch forth mine hand upon Egypt, and bring out the children
           of Israel from among them.

02:007:006 And Moses and Aaron did as the LORD commanded them, so did
           they.

02:007:007 And Moses was fourscore years old, and Aaron fourscore and
           three years old, when they spake unto Pharaoh.

02:007:008 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,

02:007:009 When Pharaoh shall speak unto you, saying, Shew a miracle for
           you: then thou shalt say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and cast it
           before Pharaoh, and it shall become a serpent.

02:007:010 And Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh, and they did so as
           the LORD had commanded: and Aaron cast down his rod before
           Pharaoh, and before his servants, and it became a serpent.

02:007:011 Then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers: now
           the magicians of Egypt, they also did in like manner with
           their enchantments.

02:007:012 For they cast down every man his rod, and they became
           serpents: but Aaron's rod swallowed up their rods.

02:007:013 And he hardened Pharaoh's heart, that he hearkened not unto
           them; as the LORD had said.

02:007:014 And the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh's heart is hardened, he
           refuseth to let the people go.

02:007:015 Get thee unto Pharaoh in the morning; lo, he goeth out unto
           the water; and thou shalt stand by the river's brink against
           he come; and the rod which was turned to a serpent shalt thou
           take in thine hand.

02:007:016 And thou shalt say unto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath
           sent me unto thee, saying, Let my people go, that they may
           serve me in the wilderness: and, behold, hitherto thou
           wouldest not hear.

02:007:017 Thus saith the LORD, In this thou shalt know that I am the
           LORD: behold, I will smite with the rod that is in mine hand
           upon the waters which are in the river, and they shall be
           turned to blood.

02:007:018 And the fish that is in the river shall die, and the river
           shall stink; and the Egyptians shall lothe to drink of the
           water of the river.

02:007:019 And the LORD spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Take thy rod,
           and stretch out thine hand upon the waters of Egypt, upon
           their streams, upon their rivers, and upon their ponds, and
           upon all their pools of water, that they may become blood; and
           that there may be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, both
           in vessels of wood, and in vessels of stone.

02:007:020 And Moses and Aaron did so, as the LORD commanded; and he
           lifted up the rod, and smote the waters that were in the
           river, in the sight of Pharaoh, and in the sight of his
           servants; and all the waters that were in the river were
           turned to blood.

02:007:021 And the fish that was in the river died; and the river stank,
           and the Egyptians could not drink of the water of the river;
           and there was blood throughout all the land of Egypt.

02:007:022 And the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments: and
           Pharaoh's heart was hardened, neither did he hearken unto
           them; as the LORD had said.

02:007:023 And Pharaoh turned and went into his house, neither did he set
           his heart to this also.

02:007:024 And all the Egyptians digged round about the river for water
           to drink; for they could not drink of the water of the river.

02:007:025 And seven days were fulfilled, after that the LORD had smitten
           the river.

02:008:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, Go unto Pharaoh, and say unto
           him, Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may
           serve me.

02:008:002 And if thou refuse to let them go, behold, I will smite all
           thy borders with frogs:

02:008:003 And the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly, which shall
           go up and come into thine house, and into thy bedchamber, and
           upon thy bed, and into the house of thy servants, and upon thy
           people, and into thine ovens, and into thy kneadingtroughs:

02:008:004 And the frogs shall come up both on thee, and upon thy people,
           and upon all thy servants.

02:008:005 And the LORD spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch forth
           thine hand with thy rod over the streams, over the rivers, and
           over the ponds, and cause frogs to come up upon the land of
           Egypt.

02:008:006 And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and
           the frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt.

02:008:007 And the magicians did so with their enchantments, and brought
           up frogs upon the land of Egypt.

02:008:008 Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, Intreat the
           LORD, that he may take away the frogs from me, and from my
           people; and I will let the people go, that they may do
           sacrifice unto the LORD.

02:008:009 And Moses said unto Pharaoh, Glory over me: when shall I
           intreat for thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people, to
           destroy the frogs from thee and thy houses, that they may
           remain in the river only?

02:008:010 And he said, To morrow. And he said, Be it according to thy
           word: that thou mayest know that there is none like unto the
           LORD our God.

02:008:011 And the frogs shall depart from thee, and from thy houses, and
           from thy servants, and from thy people; they shall remain in
           the river only.

02:008:012 And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh: and Moses cried
           unto the LORD because of the frogs which he had brought
           against Pharaoh.

02:008:013 And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and the frogs
           died out of the houses, out of the villages, and out of the
           fields.

02:008:014 And they gathered them together upon heaps: and the land
           stank.

02:008:015 But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardened his
           heart, and hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said.

02:008:016 And the LORD said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch out thy
           rod, and smite the dust of the land, that it may become lice
           throughout all the land of Egypt.

02:008:017 And they did so; for Aaron stretched out his hand with his
           rod, and smote the dust of the earth, and it became lice in
           man, and in beast; all the dust of the land became lice
           throughout all the land of Egypt.

02:008:018 And the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring
           forth lice, but they could not: so there were lice upon man,
           and upon beast.

02:008:019 Then the magicians said unto Pharaoh, This is the finger of
           God: and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he hearkened not
           unto them; as the LORD had said.

02:008:020 And the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning,
           and stand before Pharaoh; lo, he cometh forth to the water;
           and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that
           they may serve me.

02:008:021 Else, if thou wilt not let my people go, behold, I will send
           swarms of flies upon thee, and upon thy servants, and upon thy
           people, and into thy houses: and the houses of the Egyptians
           shall be full of swarms of flies, and also the ground whereon
           they are.

02:008:022 And I will sever in that day the land of Goshen, in which my
           people dwell, that no swarms of flies shall be there; to the
           end thou mayest know that I am the LORD in the midst of the
           earth.

02:008:023 And I will put a division between my people and thy people: to
           morrow shall this sign be.

02:008:024 And the LORD did so; and there came a grievous swarm of flies
           into the house of Pharaoh, and into his servants' houses, and
           into all the land of Egypt: the land was corrupted by reason
           of the swarm of flies.

02:008:025 And Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said, Go ye,
           sacrifice to your God in the land.

02:008:026 And Moses said, It is not meet so to do; for we shall
           sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to the LORD our
           God: lo, shall we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians
           before their eyes, and will they not stone us?

02:008:027 We will go three days' journey into the wilderness, and
           sacrifice to the LORD our God, as he shall command us.

02:008:028 And Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that ye may sacrifice to
           the LORD your God in the wilderness; only ye shall not go very
           far away: intreat for me.

02:008:029 And Moses said, Behold, I go out from thee, and I will intreat
           the LORD that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh,
           from his servants, and from his people, to morrow: but let not
           Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not letting the people go
           to sacrifice to the LORD.

02:008:030 And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the LORD.

02:008:031 And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and he
           removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants,
           and from his people; there remained not one.

02:008:032 And Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also, neither
           would he let the people go.

02:009:001 Then the LORD said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh, and tell
           him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, Let my people go,
           that they may serve me.

02:009:002 For if thou refuse to let them go, and wilt hold them still,

02:009:003 Behold, the hand of the LORD is upon thy cattle which is in
           the field, upon the horses, upon the asses, upon the camels,
           upon the oxen, and upon the sheep: there shall be a very
           grievous murrain.

02:009:004 And the LORD shall sever between the cattle of Israel and the
           cattle of Egypt: and there shall nothing die of all that is
           the children's of Israel.

02:009:005 And the LORD appointed a set time, saying, To morrow the LORD
           shall do this thing in the land.

02:009:006 And the LORD did that thing on the morrow, and all the cattle
           of Egypt died: but of the cattle of the children of Israel
           died not one.

02:009:007 And Pharaoh sent, and, behold, there was not one of the cattle
           of the Israelites dead. And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened,
           and he did not let the people go.

02:009:008 And the LORD said unto Moses and unto Aaron, Take to you
           handfuls of ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it
           toward the heaven in the sight of Pharaoh.

02:009:009 And it shall become small dust in all the land of Egypt, and
           shall be a boil breaking forth with blains upon man, and upon
           beast, throughout all the land of Egypt.

02:009:010 And they took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh;
           and Moses sprinkled it up toward heaven; and it became a boil
           breaking forth with blains upon man, and upon beast.

02:009:011 And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the
           boils; for the boil was upon the magicians, and upon all the
           Egyptians.

02:009:012 And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he hearkened
           not unto them; as the LORD had spoken unto Moses.

02:009:013 And the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning,
           and stand before Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith the
           LORD God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve
           me.

02:009:014 For I will at this time send all my plagues upon thine heart,
           and upon thy servants, and upon thy people; that thou mayest
           know that there is none like me in all the earth.

02:009:015 For now I will stretch out my hand, that I may smite thee and
           thy people with pestilence; and thou shalt be cut off from the
           earth.

02:009:016 And in very deed for this cause have I raised thee up, for to
           shew in thee my power; and that my name may be declared
           throughout all the earth.

02:009:017 As yet exaltest thou thyself against my people, that thou wilt
           not let them go?

02:009:018 Behold, to morrow about this time I will cause it to rain a
           very grievous hail, such as hath not been in Egypt since the
           foundation thereof even until now.

02:009:019 Send therefore now, and gather thy cattle, and all that thou
           hast in the field; for upon every man and beast which shall be
           found in the field, and shall not be brought home, the hail
           shall come down upon them, and they shall die.

02:009:020 He that feared the word of the LORD among the servants of
           Pharaoh made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses:

02:009:021 And he that regarded not the word of the LORD left his
           servants and his cattle in the field.

02:009:022 And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch forth thine hand toward
           heaven, that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, upon
           man, and upon beast, and upon every herb of the field,
           throughout the land of Egypt.

02:009:023 And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven: and the LORD
           sent thunder and hail, and the fire ran along upon the ground;
           and the LORD rained hail upon the land of Egypt.

02:009:024 So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very
           grievous, such as there was none like it in all the land of
           Egypt since it became a nation.

02:009:025 And the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that
           was in the field, both man and beast; and the hail smote every
           herb of the field, and brake every tree of the field.

02:009:026 Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were,
           was there no hail.

02:009:027 And Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said
           unto them, I have sinned this time: the LORD is righteous, and
           I and my people are wicked.

02:009:028 Intreat the LORD (for it is enough) that there be no more
           mighty thunderings and hail; and I will let you go, and ye
           shall stay no longer.

02:009:029 And Moses said unto him, As soon as I am gone out of the city,
           I will spread abroad my hands unto the LORD; and the thunder
           shall cease, neither shall there be any more hail; that thou
           mayest know how that the earth is the LORD's.

02:009:030 But as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye will not yet
           fear the LORD God.

02:009:031 And the flax and the barley was smitten: for the barley was in
           the ear, and the flax was bolled.

02:009:032 But the wheat and the rie were not smitten: for they were not
           grown up.

02:009:033 And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad
           his hands unto the LORD: and the thunders and hail ceased, and
           the rain was not poured upon the earth.

02:009:034 And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the
           thunders were ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his
           heart, he and his servants.

02:009:035 And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, neither would he let
           the children of Israel go; as the LORD had spoken by Moses.

02:010:001 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh: for I have
           hardened his heart, and the heart of his servants, that I
           might shew these my signs before him:

02:010:002 And that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son, and of thy
           son's son, what things I have wrought in Egypt, and my signs
           which I have done among them; that ye may know how that I am
           the LORD.

02:010:003 And Moses and Aaron came in unto Pharaoh, and said unto him,
           Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, How long wilt thou
           refuse to humble thyself before me? let my people go, that
           they may serve me.

02:010:004 Else, if thou refuse to let my people go, behold, to morrow
           will I bring the locusts into thy coast:

02:010:005 And they shall cover the face of the earth, that one cannot be
           able to see the earth: and they shall eat the residue of that
           which is escaped, which remaineth unto you from the hail, and
           shall eat every tree which groweth for you out of the field:

02:010:006 And they shall fill thy houses, and the houses of all thy
           servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians; which neither
           thy fathers, nor thy fathers' fathers have seen, since the day
           that they were upon the earth unto this day. And he turned
           himself, and went out from Pharaoh.

02:010:007 And Pharaoh's servants said unto him, How long shall this man
           be a snare unto us? let the men go, that they may serve the
           LORD their God: knowest thou not yet that Egypt is destroyed?

02:010:008 And Moses and Aaron were brought again unto Pharaoh: and he
           said unto them, Go, serve the LORD your God: but who are they
           that shall go?

02:010:009 And Moses said, We will go with our young and with our old,
           with our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with
           our herds will we go; for we must hold a feast unto the LORD.

02:010:010 And he said unto them, Let the LORD be so with you, as I will
           let you go, and your little ones: look to it; for evil is
           before you.

02:010:011 Not so: go now ye that are men, and serve the LORD; for that
           ye did desire. And they were driven out from Pharaoh's
           presence.

02:010:012 And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the
           land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up upon the
           land of Egypt, and eat every herb of the land, even all that
           the hail hath left.

02:010:013 And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and
           the LORD brought an east wind upon the land all that day, and
           all that night; and when it was morning, the east wind brought
           the locusts.

02:010:014 And the locust went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested
           in all the coasts of Egypt: very grievous were they; before
           them there were no such locusts as they, neither after them
           shall be such.

02:010:015 For they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land
           was darkened; and they did eat every herb of the land, and all
           the fruit of the trees which the hail had left: and there
           remained not any green thing in the trees, or in the herbs of
           the field, through all the land of Egypt.

02:010:016 Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste; and he said,
           I have sinned against the LORD your God, and against you.

02:010:017 Now therefore forgive, I pray thee, my sin only this once, and
           intreat the LORD your God, that he may take away from me this
           death only.

02:010:018 And he went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the LORD.

02:010:019 And the LORD turned a mighty strong west wind, which took away
           the locusts, and cast them into the Red sea; there remained
           not one locust in all the coasts of Egypt.

02:010:020 But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not
           let the children of Israel go.

02:010:021 And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand toward
           heaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt,
           even darkness which may be felt.

02:010:022 And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven; and there
           was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days:

02:010:023 They saw not one another, neither rose any from his place for
           three days: but all the children of Israel had light in their
           dwellings.

02:010:024 And Pharaoh called unto Moses, and said, Go ye, serve the
           LORD; only let your flocks and your herds be stayed: let your
           little ones also go with you.

02:010:025 And Moses said, Thou must give us also sacrifices and burnt
           offerings, that we may sacrifice unto the LORD our God.

02:010:026 Our cattle also shall go with us; there shall not an hoof be
           left behind; for thereof must we take to serve the LORD our
           God; and we know not with what we must serve the LORD, until
           we come thither.

02:010:027 But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he would not let
           them go.

02:010:028 And Pharaoh said unto him, Get thee from me, take heed to
           thyself, see my face no more; for in that day thou seest my
           face thou shalt die.

02:010:029 And Moses said, Thou hast spoken well, I will see thy face
           again no more.

02:011:001 And the LORD said unto Moses, Yet will I bring one plague more
           upon Pharaoh, and upon Egypt; afterwards he will let you go
           hence: when he shall let you go, he shall surely thrust you
           out hence altogether.

02:011:002 Speak now in the ears of the people, and let every man borrow
           of his neighbour, and every woman of her neighbour, jewels of
           silver and jewels of gold.

02:011:003 And the LORD gave the people favour in the sight of the
           Egyptians. Moreover the man Moses was very great in the land
           of Egypt, in the sight of Pharaoh's servants, and in the sight
           of the people.

02:011:004 And Moses said, Thus saith the LORD, About midnight will I go
           out into the midst of Egypt:

02:011:005 And all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from the
           first born of Pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne, even unto
           the firstborn of the maidservant that is behind the mill; and
           all the firstborn of beasts.

02:011:006 And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of
           Egypt, such as there was none like it, nor shall be like it
           any more.

02:011:007 But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move
           his tongue, against man or beast: that ye may know how that
           the LORD doth put a difference between the Egyptians and
           Israel.

02:011:008 And all these thy servants shall come down unto me, and bow
           down themselves unto me, saying, Get thee out, and all the
           people that follow thee: and after that I will go out. And he
           went out from Pharaoh in a great anger.

02:011:009 And the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh shall not hearken unto
           you; that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt.

02:011:010 And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh: and
           the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let
           the children of Israel go out of his land.

02:012:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt
           saying,

02:012:002 This month shall be unto you the beginning of months: it shall
           be the first month of the year to you.

02:012:003 Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the
           tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a
           lamb, according to the house of their fathers, a lamb for an
           house:

02:012:004 And if the household be too little for the lamb, let him and
           his neighbour next unto his house take it according to the
           number of the souls; every man according to his eating shall
           make your count for the lamb.

02:012:005 Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year:
           ye shall take it out from the sheep, or from the goats:

02:012:006 And ye shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same
           month: and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel
           shall kill it in the evening.

02:012:007 And they shall take of the blood, and strike it on the two
           side posts and on the upper door post of the houses, wherein
           they shall eat it.

02:012:008 And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire,
           and unleavened bread; and with bitter herbs they shall eat it.

02:012:009 Eat not of it raw, nor sodden at all with water, but roast
           with fire; his head with his legs, and with the purtenance
           thereof.

02:012:010 And ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; and
           that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn
           with fire.

02:012:011 And thus shall ye eat it; with your loins girded, your shoes
           on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and ye shall eat it
           in haste: it is the LORD's passover.

02:012:012 For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night, and will
           smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and
           beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute
           judgment: I am the LORD.

02:012:013 And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses
           where ye are: and when I see the blood, I will pass over you,
           and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you, when I
           smite the land of Egypt.

02:012:014 And this day shall be unto you for a memorial; and ye shall
           keep it a feast to the LORD throughout your generations; ye
           shall keep it a feast by an ordinance for ever.

02:012:015 Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread; even the first day
           ye shall put away leaven out of your houses: for whosoever
           eateth leavened bread from the first day until the seventh
           day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel.

02:012:016 And in the first day there shall be an holy convocation, and
           in the seventh day there shall be an holy convocation to you;
           no manner of work shall be done in them, save that which every
           man must eat, that only may be done of you.

02:012:017 And ye shall observe the feast of unleavened bread; for in
           this selfsame day have I brought your armies out of the land
           of Egypt: therefore shall ye observe this day in your
           generations by an ordinance for ever.

02:012:018 In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at
           even, ye shall eat unleavened bread, until the one and
           twentieth day of the month at even.

02:012:019 Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses: for
           whosoever eateth that which is leavened, even that soul shall
           be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he be a
           stranger, or born in the land.

02:012:020 Ye shall eat nothing leavened; in all your habitations shall
           ye eat unleavened bread.

02:012:021 Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said unto
           them, Draw out and take you a lamb according to your families,
           and kill the passover.

02:012:022 And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood
           that is in the bason, and strike the lintel and the two side
           posts with the blood that is in the bason; and none of you
           shall go out at the door of his house until the morning.

02:012:023 For the LORD will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and
           when he seeth the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side
           posts, the LORD will pass over the door, and will not suffer
           the destroyer to come in unto your houses to smite you.

02:012:024 And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and
           to thy sons for ever.

02:012:025 And it shall come to pass, when ye be come to the land which
           the LORD will give you, according as he hath promised, that ye
           shall keep this service.

02:012:026 And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say unto
           you, What mean ye by this service?

02:012:027 That ye shall say, It is the sacrifice of the LORD's passover,
           who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt,
           when he smote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses. And the
           people bowed the head and worshipped.

02:012:028 And the children of Israel went away, and did as the LORD had
           commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.

02:012:029 And it came to pass, that at midnight the LORD smote all the
           firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh
           that sat on his throne unto the firstborn of the captive that
           was in the dungeon; and all the firstborn of cattle.

02:012:030 And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants,
           and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt; for
           there was not a house where there was not one dead.

02:012:031 And he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise up,
           and get you forth from among my people, both ye and the
           children of Israel; and go, serve the LORD, as ye have said.

02:012:032 Also take your flocks and your herds, as ye have said, and be
           gone; and bless me also.

02:012:033 And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, that they might
           send them out of the land in haste; for they said, We be all
           dead men.

02:012:034 And the people took their dough before it was leavened, their
           kneadingtroughs being bound up in their clothes upon their
           shoulders.

02:012:035 And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses;
           and they borrowed of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and
           jewels of gold, and raiment:

02:012:036 And the LORD gave the people favour in the sight of the
           Egyptians, so that they lent unto them such things as they
           required. And they spoiled the Egyptians.

02:012:037 And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth,
           about six hundred thousand on foot that were men, beside
           children.

02:012:038 And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and
           herds, even very much cattle.

02:012:039 And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they
           brought forth out of Egypt, for it was not leavened; because
           they were thrust out of Egypt, and could not tarry, neither
           had they prepared for themselves any victual.

02:012:040 Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelt in
           Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years.

02:012:041 And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty
           years, even the selfsame day it came to pass, that all the
           hosts of the LORD went out from the land of Egypt.

02:012:042 It is a night to be much observed unto the LORD for bringing
           them out from the land of Egypt: this is that night of the
           LORD to be observed of all the children of Israel in their
           generations.

02:012:043 And the LORD said unto Moses and Aaron, This is the ordinance
           of the passover: There shall no stranger eat thereof:

02:012:044 But every man's servant that is bought for money, when thou
           hast circumcised him, then shall he eat thereof.

02:012:045 A foreigner and an hired servant shall not eat thereof.

02:012:046 In one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not carry forth
           ought of the flesh abroad out of the house; neither shall ye
           break a bone thereof.

02:012:047 All the congregation of Israel shall keep it.

02:012:048 And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and will keep the
           passover to the LORD, let all his males be circumcised, and
           then let him come near and keep it; and he shall be as one
           that is born in the land: for no uncircumcised person shall
           eat thereof.

02:012:049 One law shall be to him that is homeborn, and unto the
           stranger that sojourneth among you.

02:012:050 Thus did all the children of Israel; as the LORD commanded
           Moses and Aaron, so did they.

02:012:051 And it came to pass the selfsame day, that the LORD did bring
           the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their
           armies.

02:013:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

02:013:002 Sanctify unto me all the firstborn, whatsoever openeth the
           womb among the children of Israel, both of man and of beast:
           it is mine.

02:013:003 And Moses said unto the people, Remember this day, in which ye
           came out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by
           strength of hand the LORD brought you out from this place:
           there shall no leavened bread be eaten.

02:013:004 This day came ye out in the month Abib.

02:013:005 And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land
           of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the
           Hivites, and the Jebusites, which he sware unto thy fathers to
           give thee, a land flowing with milk and honey, that thou shalt
           keep this service in this month.

02:013:006 Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, and in the seventh
           day shall be a feast to the LORD.

02:013:007 Unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days; and there shall no
           leavened bread be seen with thee, neither shall there be
           leaven seen with thee in all thy quarters.

02:013:008 And thou shalt shew thy son in that day, saying, This is done
           because of that which the LORD did unto me when I came forth
           out of Egypt.

02:013:009 And it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thine hand, and for
           a memorial between thine eyes, that the LORD's law may be in
           thy mouth: for with a strong hand hath the LORD brought thee
           out of Egypt.

02:013:010 Thou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in his season from
           year to year.

02:013:011 And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land
           of the Canaanites, as he sware unto thee and to thy fathers,
           and shall give it thee,

02:013:012 That thou shalt set apart unto the LORD all that openeth the
           matrix, and every firstling that cometh of a beast which thou
           hast; the males shall be the LORD's.

02:013:013 And every firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb;
           and if thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break his
           neck: and all the firstborn of man among thy children shalt
           thou redeem.

02:013:014 And it shall be when thy son asketh thee in time to come,
           saying, What is this? that thou shalt say unto him, By
           strength of hand the LORD brought us out from Egypt, from the
           house of bondage:

02:013:015 And it came to pass, when Pharaoh would hardly let us go, that
           the LORD slew all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the
           firstborn of man, and the firstborn of beast: therefore I
           sacrifice to the LORD all that openeth the matrix, being
           males; but all the firstborn of my children I redeem.

02:013:016 And it shall be for a token upon thine hand, and for frontlets
           between thine eyes: for by strength of hand the LORD brought
           us forth out of Egypt.

02:013:017 And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that
           God led them not through the way of the land of the
           Philistines, although that was near; for God said, Lest
           peradventure the people repent when they see war, and they
           return to Egypt:

02:013:018 But God led the people about, through the way of the
           wilderness of the Red sea: and the children of Israel went up
           harnessed out of the land of Egypt.

02:013:019 And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him: for he had
           straitly sworn the children of Israel, saying, God will surely
           visit you; and ye shall carry up my bones away hence with you.

02:013:020 And they took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in
           Etham, in the edge of the wilderness.

02:013:021 And the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud,
           to lead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to
           give them light; to go by day and night:

02:013:022 He took not away the pillar of the cloud by day, nor the
           pillar of fire by night, from before the people.

02:014:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

02:014:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, that they turn and encamp
           before Pihahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, over against
           Baalzephon: before it shall ye encamp by the sea.

02:014:003 For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They are
           entangled in the land, the wilderness hath shut them in.

02:014:004 And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, that he shall follow after
           them; and I will be honoured upon Pharaoh, and upon all his
           host; that the Egyptians may know that I am the LORD. And they
           did so.

02:014:005 And it was told the king of Egypt that the people fled: and
           the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against
           the people, and they said, Why have we done this, that we have
           let Israel go from serving us?

02:014:006 And he made ready his chariot, and took his people with him:

02:014:007 And he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots
           of Egypt, and captains over every one of them.

02:014:008 And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and
           he pursued after the children of Israel: and the children of
           Israel went out with an high hand.

02:014:009 But the Egyptians pursued after them, all the horses and
           chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army, and
           overtook them encamping by the sea, beside Pihahiroth, before
           Baalzephon.

02:014:010 And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up
           their eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and
           they were sore afraid: and the children of Israel cried out
           unto the LORD.

02:014:011 And they said unto Moses, Because there were no graves in
           Egypt, hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness?
           wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us, to carry us forth out
           of Egypt?

02:014:012 Is not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt, saying,
           Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians? For it had been
           better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die
           in the wilderness.

02:014:013 And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still, and
           see the salvation of the LORD, which he will shew to you to
           day: for the Egyptians whom ye have seen to day, ye shall see
           them again no more for ever.

02:014:014 The LORD shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace.

02:014:015 And the LORD said unto Moses, Wherefore criest thou unto me?
           speak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward:

02:014:016 But lift thou up thy rod, and stretch out thine hand over the
           sea, and divide it: and the children of Israel shall go on dry
           ground through the midst of the sea.

02:014:017 And I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and
           they shall follow them: and I will get me honour upon Pharaoh,
           and upon all his host, upon his chariots, and upon his
           horsemen.

02:014:018 And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I have
           gotten me honour upon Pharaoh, upon his chariots, and upon his
           horsemen.

02:014:019 And the angel of God, which went before the camp of Israel,
           removed and went behind them; and the pillar of the cloud went
           from before their face, and stood behind them:

02:014:020 And it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of
           Israel; and it was a cloud and darkness to them, but it gave
           light by night to these: so that the one came not near the
           other all the night.

02:014:021 And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the LORD
           caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that
           night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided.

02:014:022 And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon
           the dry ground: and the waters were a wall unto them on their
           right hand, and on their left.

02:014:023 And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them to the midst
           of the sea, even all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his
           horsemen.

02:014:024 And it came to pass, that in the morning watch the LORD looked
           unto the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and
           of the cloud, and troubled the host of the Egyptians,

02:014:025 And took off their chariot wheels, that they drave them
           heavily: so that the Egyptians said, Let us flee from the face
           of Israel; for the LORD fighteth for them against the
           Egyptians.

02:014:026 And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the
           sea, that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians, upon
           their chariots, and upon their horsemen.

02:014:027 And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea
           returned to his strength when the morning appeared; and the
           Egyptians fled against it; and the LORD overthrew the
           Egyptians in the midst of the sea.

02:014:028 And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the
           horsemen, and all the host of Pharaoh that came into the sea
           after them; there remained not so much as one of them.

02:014:029 But the children of Israel walked upon dry land in the midst
           of the sea; and the waters were a wall unto them on their
           right hand, and on their left.

02:014:030 Thus the LORD saved Israel that day out of the hand of the
           Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea
           shore.

02:014:031 And Israel saw that great work which the LORD did upon the
           Egyptians: and the people feared the LORD, and believed the
           LORD, and his servant Moses.

02:015:001 Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the
           LORD, and spake, saying, I will sing unto the LORD, for he
           hath triumphed gloriously: the horse and his rider hath he
           thrown into the sea.

02:015:002 The LORD is my strength and song, and he is become my
           salvation: he is my God, and I will prepare him an habitation;
           my father's God, and I will exalt him.

02:015:003 The LORD is a man of war: the LORD is his name.

02:015:004 Pharaoh's chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea: his
           chosen captains also are drowned in the Red sea.

02:015:005 The depths have covered them: they sank into the bottom as a
           stone.

02:015:006 Thy right hand, O LORD, is become glorious in power: thy right
           hand, O LORD, hath dashed in pieces the enemy.

02:015:007 And in the greatness of thine excellency thou hast overthrown
           them that rose up against thee: thou sentest forth thy wrath,
           which consumed them as stubble.

02:015:008 And with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were gathered
           together, the floods stood upright as an heap, and the depths
           were congealed in the heart of the sea.

02:015:009 The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide
           the spoil; my lust shall be satisfied upon them; I will draw
           my sword, my hand shall destroy them.

02:015:010 Thou didst blow with thy wind, the sea covered them: they sank
           as lead in the mighty waters.

02:015:011 Who is like unto thee, O LORD, among the gods? who is like
           thee, glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders?

02:015:012 Thou stretchedst out thy right hand, the earth swallowed them.

02:015:013 Thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people which thou hast
           redeemed: thou hast guided them in thy strength unto thy holy
           habitation.

02:015:014 The people shall hear, and be afraid: sorrow shall take hold
           on the inhabitants of Palestina.

02:015:015 Then the dukes of Edom shall be amazed; the mighty men of
           Moab, trembling shall take hold upon them; all the inhabitants
           of Canaan shall melt away.

02:015:016 Fear and dread shall fall upon them; by the greatness of thine
           arm they shall be as still as a stone; till thy people pass
           over, O LORD, till the people pass over, which thou hast
           purchased.

02:015:017 Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of
           thine inheritance, in the place, O LORD, which thou hast made
           for thee to dwell in, in the Sanctuary, O LORD, which thy
           hands have established.

02:015:018 The LORD shall reign for ever and ever.

02:015:019 For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with
           his horsemen into the sea, and the LORD brought again the
           waters of the sea upon them; but the children of Israel went
           on dry land in the midst of the sea.

02:015:020 And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel
           in her hand; and all the women went out after her with
           timbrels and with dances.

02:015:021 And Miriam answered them, Sing ye to the LORD, for he hath
           triumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider hath he thrown
           into the sea.

02:015:022 So Moses brought Israel from the Red sea, and they went out
           into the wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the
           wilderness, and found no water.

02:015:023 And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the
           waters of Marah, for they were bitter: therefore the name of
           it was called Marah.

02:015:024 And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we
           drink?

02:015:025 And he cried unto the LORD; and the LORD shewed him a tree,
           which when he had cast into the waters, the waters were made
           sweet: there he made for them a statute and an ordinance, and
           there he proved them,

02:015:026 And said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the
           LORD thy God, and wilt do that which is right in his sight,
           and wilt give ear to his commandments, and keep all his
           statutes, I will put none of these diseases upon thee, which I
           have brought upon the Egyptians: for I am the LORD that
           healeth thee.

02:015:027 And they came to Elim, where were twelve wells of water, and
           threescore and ten palm trees: and they encamped there by the
           waters.

02:016:001 And they took their journey from Elim, and all the
           congregation of the children of Israel came unto the
           wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the
           fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out of
           the land of Egypt.

02:016:002 And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured
           against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness:

02:016:003 And the children of Israel said unto them, Would to God we had
           died by the hand of the LORD in the land of Egypt, when we sat
           by the flesh pots, and when we did eat bread to the full; for
           ye have brought us forth into this wilderness, to kill this
           whole assembly with hunger.

02:016:004 Then said the LORD unto Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from
           heaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather a
           certain rate every day, that I may prove them, whether they
           will walk in my law, or no.

02:016:005 And it shall come to pass, that on the sixth day they shall
           prepare that which they bring in; and it shall be twice as
           much as they gather daily.

02:016:006 And Moses and Aaron said unto all the children of Israel, At
           even, then ye shall know that the LORD hath brought you out
           from the land of Egypt:

02:016:007 And in the morning, then ye shall see the glory of the LORD;
           for that he heareth your murmurings against the LORD: and what
           are we, that ye murmur against us?

02:016:008 And Moses said, This shall be, when the LORD shall give you in
           the evening flesh to eat, and in the morning bread to the
           full; for that the LORD heareth your murmurings which ye
           murmur against him: and what are we? your murmurings are not
           against us, but against the LORD.

02:016:009 And Moses spake unto Aaron, Say unto all the congregation of
           the children of Israel, Come near before the LORD: for he hath
           heard your murmurings.

02:016:010 And it came to pass, as Aaron spake unto the whole
           congregation of the children of Israel, that they looked
           toward the wilderness, and, behold, the glory of the LORD
           appeared in the cloud.

02:016:011 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

02:016:012 I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel: speak
           unto them, saying, At even ye shall eat flesh, and in the
           morning ye shall be filled with bread; and ye shall know that
           I am the LORD your God.

02:016:013 And it came to pass, that at even the quails came up, and
           covered the camp: and in the morning the dew lay round about
           the host.

02:016:014 And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face
           of the wilderness there lay a small round thing, as small as
           the hoar frost on the ground.

02:016:015 And when the children of Israel saw it, they said one to
           another, It is manna: for they wist not what it was. And Moses
           said unto them, This is the bread which the LORD hath given
           you to eat.

02:016:016 This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded, Gather of it
           every man according to his eating, an omer for every man,
           according to the number of your persons; take ye every man for
           them which are in his tents.

02:016:017 And the children of Israel did so, and gathered, some more,
           some less.

02:016:018 And when they did mete it with an omer, he that gathered much
           had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack;
           they gathered every man according to his eating.

02:016:019 And Moses said, Let no man leave of it till the morning.

02:016:020 Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses; but some of
           them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and
           stank: and Moses was wroth with them.

02:016:021 And they gathered it every morning, every man according to his
           eating: and when the sun waxed hot, it melted.

02:016:022 And it came to pass, that on the sixth day they gathered twice
           as much bread, two omers for one man: and all the rulers of
           the congregation came and told Moses.

02:016:023 And he said unto them, This is that which the LORD hath said,
           To morrow is the rest of the holy sabbath unto the LORD: bake
           that which ye will bake to day, and seethe that ye will
           seethe; and that which remaineth over lay up for you to be
           kept until the morning.

02:016:024 And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses bade: and it
           did not stink, neither was there any worm therein.

02:016:025 And Moses said, Eat that to day; for to day is a sabbath unto
           the LORD: to day ye shall not find it in the field.

02:016:026 Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day, which is
           the sabbath, in it there shall be none.

02:016:027 And it came to pass, that there went out some of the people on
           the seventh day for to gather, and they found none.

02:016:028 And the LORD said unto Moses, How long refuse ye to keep my
           commandments and my laws?

02:016:029 See, for that the LORD hath given you the sabbath, therefore
           he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days; abide ye
           every man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the
           seventh day.

02:016:030 So the people rested on the seventh day.

02:016:031 And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna: and it
           was like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it was like
           wafers made with honey.

02:016:032 And Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD commandeth,
           Fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations; that they
           may see the bread wherewith I have fed you in the wilderness,
           when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt.

02:016:033 And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer full of
           manna therein, and lay it up before the LORD, to be kept for
           your generations.

02:016:034 As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the
           Testimony, to be kept.

02:016:035 And the children of Israel did eat manna forty years, until
           they came to a land inhabited; they did eat manna, until they
           came unto the borders of the land of Canaan.

02:016:036 Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah.

02:017:001 And all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed
           from the wilderness of Sin, after their journeys, according to
           the commandment of the LORD, and pitched in Rephidim: and
           there was no water for the people to drink.

02:017:002 Wherefore the people did chide with Moses, and said, Give us
           water that we may drink. And Moses said unto them, Why chide
           ye with me? wherefore do ye tempt the LORD?

02:017:003 And the people thirsted there for water; and the people
           murmured against Moses, and said, Wherefore is this that thou
           hast brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children
           and our cattle with thirst?

02:017:004 And Moses cried unto the LORD, saying, What shall I do unto
           this people? they be almost ready to stone me.

02:017:005 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go on before the people, and
           take with thee of the elders of Israel; and thy rod, wherewith
           thou smotest the river, take in thine hand, and go.

02:017:006 Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb;
           and thou shalt smite the rock, and there shall come water out
           of it, that the people may drink. And Moses did so in the
           sight of the elders of Israel.

02:017:007 And he called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah,
           because of the chiding of the children of Israel, and because
           they tempted the LORD, saying, Is the LORD among us, or not?

02:017:008 Then came Amalek, and fought with Israel in Rephidim.

02:017:009 And Moses said unto Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out,
           fight with Amalek: to morrow I will stand on the top of the
           hill with the rod of God in mine hand.

02:017:010 So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with
           Amalek: and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the
           hill.

02:017:011 And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel
           prevailed: and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.

02:017:012 But Moses hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it
           under him, and he sat thereon; and Aaron and Hur stayed up his
           hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other
           side; and his hands were steady until the going down of the
           sun.

02:017:013 And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of
           the sword.

02:017:014 And the LORD said unto Moses, Write this for a memorial in a
           book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: for I will
           utterly put out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.

02:017:015 And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it
           Jehovahnissi:

02:017:016 For he said, Because the LORD hath sworn that the LORD will
           have war with Amalek from generation to generation.

02:018:001 When Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses' father in law, heard
           of all that God had done for Moses, and for Israel his people,
           and that the LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt;

02:018:002 Then Jethro, Moses' father in law, took Zipporah, Moses' wife,
           after he had sent her back,

02:018:003 And her two sons; of which the name of the one was Gershom;
           for he said, I have been an alien in a strange land:

02:018:004 And the name of the other was Eliezer; for the God of my
           father, said he, was mine help, and delivered me from the
           sword of Pharaoh:

02:018:005 And Jethro, Moses' father in law, came with his sons and his
           wife unto Moses into the wilderness, where he encamped at the
           mount of God:

02:018:006 And he said unto Moses, I thy father in law Jethro am come
           unto thee, and thy wife, and her two sons with her.

02:018:007 And Moses went out to meet his father in law, and did
           obeisance, and kissed him; and they asked each other of their
           welfare; and they came into the tent.

02:018:008 And Moses told his father in law all that the LORD had done
           unto Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel's sake, and all
           the travail that had come upon them by the way, and how the
           LORD delivered them.

02:018:009 And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the LORD had
           done to Israel, whom he had delivered out of the hand of the
           Egyptians.

02:018:010 And Jethro said, Blessed be the LORD, who hath delivered you
           out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of
           Pharaoh, who hath delivered the people from under the hand of
           the Egyptians.

02:018:011 Now I know that the LORD is greater than all gods: for in the
           thing wherein they dealt proudly he was above them.

02:018:012 And Jethro, Moses' father in law, took a burnt offering and
           sacrifices for God: and Aaron came, and all the elders of
           Israel, to eat bread with Moses' father in law before God.

02:018:013 And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the
           people: and the people stood by Moses from the morning unto
           the evening.

02:018:014 And when Moses' father in law saw all that he did to the
           people, he said, What is this thing that thou doest to the
           people? why sittest thou thyself alone, and all the people
           stand by thee from morning unto even?

02:018:015 And Moses said unto his father in law, Because the people come
           unto me to enquire of God:

02:018:016 When they have a matter, they come unto me; and I judge
           between one and another, and I do make them know the statutes
           of God, and his laws.

02:018:017 And Moses' father in law said unto him, The thing that thou
           doest is not good.

02:018:018 Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that is
           with thee: for this thing is too heavy for thee; thou art not
           able to perform it thyself alone.

02:018:019 Hearken now unto my voice, I will give thee counsel, and God
           shall be with thee: Be thou for the people to God-ward, that
           thou mayest bring the causes unto God:

02:018:020 And thou shalt teach them ordinances and laws, and shalt shew
           them the way wherein they must walk, and the work that they
           must do.

02:018:021 Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men,
           such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place
           such over them, to be rulers of thousands, and rulers of
           hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens:

02:018:022 And let them judge the people at all seasons: and it shall be,
           that every great matter they shall bring unto thee, but every
           small matter they shall judge: so shall it be easier for
           thyself, and they shall bear the burden with thee.

02:018:023 If thou shalt do this thing, and God command thee so, then
           thou shalt be able to endure, and all this people shall also
           go to their place in peace.

02:018:024 So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father in law, and did
           all that he had said.

02:018:025 And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them
           heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of
           hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.

02:018:026 And they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes
           they brought unto Moses, but every small matter they judged
           themselves.

02:018:027 And Moses let his father in law depart; and he went his way
           into his own land.

02:019:001 In the third month, when the children of Israel were gone
           forth out of the land of Egypt, the same day came they into
           the wilderness of Sinai.

02:019:002 For they were departed from Rephidim, and were come to the
           desert of Sinai, and had pitched in the wilderness; and there
           Israel camped before the mount.

02:019:003 And Moses went up unto God, and the LORD called unto him out
           of the mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of
           Jacob, and tell the children of Israel;

02:019:004 Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bare you
           on eagles' wings, and brought you unto myself.

02:019:005 Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my
           covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above
           all people: for all the earth is mine:

02:019:006 And ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and an holy
           nation. These are the words which thou shalt speak unto the
           children of Israel.

02:019:007 And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and
           laid before their faces all these words which the LORD
           commanded him.

02:019:008 And all the people answered together, and said, All that the
           LORD hath spoken we will do. And Moses returned the words of
           the people unto the LORD.

02:019:009 And the LORD said unto Moses, Lo, I come unto thee in a thick
           cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and
           believe thee for ever. And Moses told the words of the people
           unto the LORD.

02:019:010 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go unto the people, and sanctify
           them to day and to morrow, and let them wash their clothes,

02:019:011 And be ready against the third day: for the third day the LORD
           will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount
           Sinai.

02:019:012 And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about, saying,
           Take heed to yourselves, that ye go not up into the mount, or
           touch the border of it: whosoever toucheth the mount shall be
           surely put to death:

02:019:013 There shall not an hand touch it, but he shall surely be
           stoned, or shot through; whether it be beast or man, it shall
           not live: when the trumpet soundeth long, they shall come up
           to the mount.

02:019:014 And Moses went down from the mount unto the people, and
           sanctified the people; and they washed their clothes.

02:019:015 And he said unto the people, Be ready against the third day:
           come not at your wives.

02:019:016 And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that
           there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the
           mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that
           all the people that was in the camp trembled.

02:019:017 And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet
           with God; and they stood at the nether part of the mount.

02:019:018 And mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the LORD
           descended upon it in fire: and the smoke thereof ascended as
           the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly.

02:019:019 And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed
           louder and louder, Moses spake, and God answered him by a
           voice.

02:019:020 And the LORD came down upon mount Sinai, on the top of the
           mount: and the LORD called Moses up to the top of the mount;
           and Moses went up.

02:019:021 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest
           they break through unto the LORD to gaze, and many of them
           perish.

02:019:022 And let the priests also, which come near to the LORD,
           sanctify themselves, lest the LORD break forth upon them.

02:019:023 And Moses said unto the LORD, The people cannot come up to
           mount Sinai: for thou chargedst us, saying, Set bounds about
           the mount, and sanctify it.

02:019:024 And the LORD said unto him, Away, get thee down, and thou
           shalt come up, thou, and Aaron with thee: but let not the
           priests and the people break through to come up unto the LORD,
           lest he break forth upon them.

02:019:025 So Moses went down unto the people, and spake unto them.

02:020:001 And God spake all these words, saying,

02:020:002 I am the LORD thy God, which have brought thee out of the land
           of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.

02:020:003 Thou shalt have no other gods before me.

02:020:004 Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any
           likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in
           the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth.

02:020:005 Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I
           the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of
           the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth
           generation of them that hate me;

02:020:006 And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and
           keep my commandments.

02:020:007 Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain; for
           the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in
           vain.

02:020:008 Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.

02:020:009 Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work:

02:020:010 But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it
           thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy
           daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle,
           nor thy stranger that is within thy gates:

02:020:011 For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and
           all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the
           LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.

02:020:012 Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long
           upon the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.

02:020:013 Thou shalt not kill.

02:020:014 Thou shalt not commit adultery.

02:020:015 Thou shalt not steal.

02:020:016 Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.

02:020:017 Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house, thou shalt not
           covet thy neighbour's wife, nor his manservant, nor his
           maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is
           thy neighbour's.

02:020:018 And all the people saw the thunderings, and the lightnings,
           and the noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and
           when the people saw it, they removed, and stood afar off.

02:020:019 And they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will
           hear: but let not God speak with us, lest we die.

02:020:020 And Moses said unto the people, Fear not: for God is come to
           prove you, and that his fear may be before your faces, that ye
           sin not.

02:020:021 And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near unto the
           thick darkness where God was.

02:020:022 And the LORD said unto Moses, Thus thou shalt say unto the
           children of Israel, Ye have seen that I have talked with you
           from heaven.

02:020:023 Ye shall not make with me gods of silver, neither shall ye
           make unto you gods of gold.

02:020:024 An altar of earth thou shalt make unto me, and shalt sacrifice
           thereon thy burnt offerings, and thy peace offerings, thy
           sheep, and thine oxen: in all places where I record my name I
           will come unto thee, and I will bless thee.

02:020:025 And if thou wilt make me an altar of stone, thou shalt not
           build it of hewn stone: for if thou lift up thy tool upon it,
           thou hast polluted it.

02:020:026 Neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar, that thy
           nakedness be not discovered thereon.

02:021:001 Now these are the judgments which thou shalt set before them.

02:021:002 If thou buy an Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve: and
           in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing.

02:021:003 If he came in by himself, he shall go out by himself: if he
           were married, then his wife shall go out with him.

02:021:004 If his master have given him a wife, and she have born him
           sons or daughters; the wife and her children shall be her
           master's, and he shall go out by himself.

02:021:005 And if the servant shall plainly say, I love my master, my
           wife, and my children; I will not go out free:

02:021:006 Then his master shall bring him unto the judges; he shall also
           bring him to the door, or unto the door post; and his master
           shall bore his ear through with an aul; and he shall serve him
           for ever.

02:021:007 And if a man sell his daughter to be a maidservant, she shall
           not go out as the menservants do.

02:021:008 If she please not her master, who hath betrothed her to
           himself, then shall he let her be redeemed: to sell her unto a
           strange nation he shall have no power, seeing he hath dealt
           deceitfully with her.

02:021:009 And if he have betrothed her unto his son, he shall deal with
           her after the manner of daughters.

02:021:010 If he take him another wife; her food, her raiment, and her
           duty of marriage, shall he not diminish.

02:021:011 And if he do not these three unto her, then shall she go out
           free without money.

02:021:012 He that smiteth a man, so that he die, shall be surely put to
           death.

02:021:013 And if a man lie not in wait, but God deliver him into his
           hand; then I will appoint thee a place whither he shall flee.

02:021:014 But if a man come presumptuously upon his neighbour, to slay
           him with guile; thou shalt take him from mine altar, that he
           may die.

02:021:015 And he that smiteth his father, or his mother, shall be surely
           put to death.

02:021:016 And he that stealeth a man, and selleth him, or if he be found
           in his hand, he shall surely be put to death.

02:021:017 And he that curseth his father, or his mother, shall surely be
           put to death.

02:021:018 And if men strive together, and one smite another with a
           stone, or with his fist, and he die not, but keepeth his bed:

02:021:019 If he rise again, and walk abroad upon his staff, then shall
           he that smote him be quit: only he shall pay for the loss of
           his time, and shall cause him to be thoroughly healed.

02:021:020 And if a man smite his servant, or his maid, with a rod, and
           he die under his hand; he shall be surely punished.

02:021:021 Notwithstanding, if he continue a day or two, he shall not be
           punished: for he is his money.

02:021:022 If men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit
           depart from her, and yet no mischief follow: he shall be
           surely punished, according as the woman's husband will lay
           upon him; and he shall pay as the judges determine.

02:021:023 And if any mischief follow, then thou shalt give life for
           life,

02:021:024 Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,

02:021:025 Burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.

02:021:026 And if a man smite the eye of his servant, or the eye of his
           maid, that it perish; he shall let him go free for his eye's
           sake.

02:021:027 And if he smite out his manservant's tooth, or his
           maidservant's tooth; he shall let him go free for his tooth's
           sake.

02:021:028 If an ox gore a man or a woman, that they die: then the ox
           shall be surely stoned, and his flesh shall not be eaten; but
           the owner of the ox shall be quit.

02:021:029 But if the ox were wont to push with his horn in time past,
           and it hath been testified to his owner, and he hath not kept
           him in, but that he hath killed a man or a woman; the ox shall
           be stoned, and his owner also shall be put to death.

02:021:030 If there be laid on him a sum of money, then he shall give for
           the ransom of his life whatsoever is laid upon him.

02:021:031 Whether he have gored a son, or have gored a daughter,
           according to this judgment shall it be done unto him.

02:021:032 If the ox shall push a manservant or a maidservant; he shall
           give unto their master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox
           shall be stoned.

02:021:033 And if a man shall open a pit, or if a man shall dig a pit,
           and not cover it, and an ox or an ass fall therein;

02:021:034 The owner of the pit shall make it good, and give money unto
           the owner of them; and the dead beast shall be his.

02:021:035 And if one man's ox hurt another's, that he die; then they
           shall sell the live ox, and divide the money of it; and the
           dead ox also they shall divide.

02:021:036 Or if it be known that the ox hath used to push in time past,
           and his owner hath not kept him in; he shall surely pay ox for
           ox; and the dead shall be his own.

02:022:001 If a man shall steal an ox, or a sheep, and kill it, or sell
           it; he shall restore five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for a
           sheep.

02:022:002 If a thief be found breaking up, and be smitten that he die,
           there shall no blood be shed for him.

02:022:003 If the sun be risen upon him, there shall be blood shed for
           him; for he should make full restitution; if he have nothing,
           then he shall be sold for his theft.

02:022:004 If the theft be certainly found in his hand alive, whether it
           be ox, or ass, or sheep; he shall restore double.

02:022:005 If a man shall cause a field or vineyard to be eaten, and
           shall put in his beast, and shall feed in another man's field;
           of the best of his own field, and of the best of his own
           vineyard, shall he make restitution.

02:022:006 If fire break out, and catch in thorns, so that the stacks of
           corn, or the standing corn, or the field, be consumed
           therewith; he that kindled the fire shall surely make
           restitution.

02:022:007 If a man shall deliver unto his neighbour money or stuff to
           keep, and it be stolen out of the man's house; if the thief be
           found, let him pay double.

02:022:008 If the thief be not found, then the master of the house shall
           be brought unto the judges, to see whether he have put his
           hand unto his neighbour's goods.

02:022:009 For all manner of trespass, whether it be for ox, for ass, for
           sheep, for raiment, or for any manner of lost thing which
           another challengeth to be his, the cause of both parties shall
           come before the judges; and whom the judges shall condemn, he
           shall pay double unto his neighbour.

02:022:010 If a man deliver unto his neighbour an ass, or an ox, or a
           sheep, or any beast, to keep; and it die, or be hurt, or
           driven away, no man seeing it:

02:022:011 Then shall an oath of the LORD be between them both, that he
           hath not put his hand unto his neighbour's goods; and the
           owner of it shall accept thereof, and he shall not make it
           good.

02:022:012 And if it be stolen from him, he shall make restitution unto
           the owner thereof.

02:022:013 If it be torn in pieces, then let him bring it for witness,
           and he shall not make good that which was torn.

02:022:014 And if a man borrow ought of his neighbour, and it be hurt, or
           die, the owner thereof being not with it, he shall surely make
           it good.

02:022:015 But if the owner thereof be with it, he shall not make it
           good: if it be an hired thing, it came for his hire.

02:022:016 And if a man entice a maid that is not betrothed, and lie with
           her, he shall surely endow her to be his wife.

02:022:017 If her father utterly refuse to give her unto him, he shall
           pay money according to the dowry of virgins.

02:022:018 Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.

02:022:019 Whosoever lieth with a beast shall surely be put to death.

02:022:020 He that sacrificeth unto any god, save unto the LORD only, he
           shall be utterly destroyed.

02:022:021 Thou shalt neither vex a stranger, nor oppress him: for ye
           were strangers in the land of Egypt.

02:022:022 Ye shall not afflict any widow, or fatherless child.

02:022:023 If thou afflict them in any wise, and they cry at all unto me,
           I will surely hear their cry;

02:022:024 And my wrath shall wax hot, and I will kill you with the
           sword; and your wives shall be widows, and your children
           fatherless.

02:022:025 If thou lend money to any of my people that is poor by thee,
           thou shalt not be to him as an usurer, neither shalt thou lay
           upon him usury.

02:022:026 If thou at all take thy neighbour's raiment to pledge, thou
           shalt deliver it unto him by that the sun goeth down:

02:022:027 For that is his covering only, it is his raiment for his skin:
           wherein shall he sleep? and it shall come to pass, when he
           crieth unto me, that I will hear; for I am gracious.

02:022:028 Thou shalt not revile the gods, nor curse the ruler of thy
           people.

02:022:029 Thou shalt not delay to offer the first of thy ripe fruits,
           and of thy liquors: the firstborn of thy sons shalt thou give
           unto me.

02:022:030 Likewise shalt thou do with thine oxen, and with thy sheep:
           seven days it shall be with his dam; on the eighth day thou
           shalt give it me.

02:022:031 And ye shall be holy men unto me: neither shall ye eat any
           flesh that is torn of beasts in the field; ye shall cast it to
           the dogs.

02:023:001 Thou shalt not raise a false report: put not thine hand with
           the wicked to be an unrighteous witness.

02:023:002 Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil; neither shalt
           thou speak in a cause to decline after many to wrest judgment:

02:023:003 Neither shalt thou countenance a poor man in his cause.

02:023:004 If thou meet thine enemy's ox or his ass going astray, thou
           shalt surely bring it back to him again.

02:023:005 If thou see the ass of him that hateth thee lying under his
           burden, and wouldest forbear to help him, thou shalt surely
           help with him.

02:023:006 Thou shalt not wrest the judgment of thy poor in his cause.

02:023:007 Keep thee far from a false matter; and the innocent and
           righteous slay thou not: for I will not justify the wicked.

02:023:008 And thou shalt take no gift: for the gift blindeth the wise,
           and perverteth the words of the righteous.

02:023:009 Also thou shalt not oppress a stranger: for ye know the heart
           of a stranger, seeing ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.

02:023:010 And six years thou shalt sow thy land, and shalt gather in the
           fruits thereof:

02:023:011 But the seventh year thou shalt let it rest and lie still;
           that the poor of thy people may eat: and what they leave the
           beasts of the field shall eat. In like manner thou shalt deal
           with thy vineyard, and with thy oliveyard.

02:023:012 Six days thou shalt do thy work, and on the seventh day thou
           shalt rest: that thine ox and thine ass may rest, and the son
           of thy handmaid, and the stranger, may be refreshed.

02:023:013 And in all things that I have said unto you be circumspect:
           and make no mention of the name of other gods, neither let it
           be heard out of thy mouth.

02:023:014 Three times thou shalt keep a feast unto me in the year.

02:023:015 Thou shalt keep the feast of unleavened bread: (thou shalt eat
           unleavened bread seven days, as I commanded thee, in the time
           appointed of the month Abib; for in it thou camest out from
           Egypt: and none shall appear before me empty:)

02:023:016 And the feast of harvest, the firstfruits of thy labours,
           which thou hast sown in the field: and the feast of
           ingathering, which is in the end of the year, when thou hast
           gathered in thy labours out of the field.

02:023:017 Three times in the year all thy males shall appear before the
           LORD God.

02:023:018 Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened
           bread; neither shall the fat of my sacrifice remain until the
           morning.

02:023:019 The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring into
           the house of the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in
           his mother's milk.

02:023:020 Behold, I send an Angel before thee, to keep thee in the way,
           and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared.

02:023:021 Beware of him, and obey his voice, provoke him not; for he
           will not pardon your transgressions: for my name is in him.

02:023:022 But if thou shalt indeed obey his voice, and do all that I
           speak; then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies, and an
           adversary unto thine adversaries.

02:023:023 For mine Angel shall go before thee, and bring thee in unto
           the Amorites, and the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the
           Canaanites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites: and I will cut
           them off.

02:023:024 Thou shalt not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do
           after their works: but thou shalt utterly overthrow them, and
           quite break down their images.

02:023:025 And ye shall serve the LORD your God, and he shall bless thy
           bread, and thy water; and I will take sickness away from the
           midst of thee.

02:023:026 There shall nothing cast their young, nor be barren, in thy
           land: the number of thy days I will fulfil.

02:023:027 I will send my fear before thee, and will destroy all the
           people to whom thou shalt come, and I will make all thine
           enemies turn their backs unto thee.

02:023:028 And I will send hornets before thee, which shall drive out the
           Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite, from before thee.

02:023:029 I will not drive them out from before thee in one year; lest
           the land become desolate, and the beast of the field multiply
           against thee.

02:023:030 By little and little I will drive them out from before thee,
           until thou be increased, and inherit the land.

02:023:031 And I will set thy bounds from the Red sea even unto the sea
           of the Philistines, and from the desert unto the river: for I
           will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand; and
           thou shalt drive them out before thee.

02:023:032 Thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor with their gods.

02:023:033 They shall not dwell in thy land, lest they make thee sin
           against me: for if thou serve their gods, it will surely be a
           snare unto thee.

02:024:001 And he said unto Moses, Come up unto the LORD, thou, and
           Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel;
           and worship ye afar off.

02:024:002 And Moses alone shall come near the LORD: but they shall not
           come nigh; neither shall the people go up with him.

02:024:003 And Moses came and told the people all the words of the LORD,
           and all the judgments: and all the people answered with one
           voice, and said, All the words which the LORD hath said will
           we do.

02:024:004 And Moses wrote all the words of the LORD, and rose up early
           in the morning, and builded an altar under the hill, and
           twelve pillars, according to the twelve tribes of Israel.

02:024:005 And he sent young men of the children of Israel, which offered
           burnt offerings, and sacrificed peace offerings of oxen unto
           the LORD.

02:024:006 And Moses took half of the blood, and put it in basons; and
           half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar.

02:024:007 And he took the book of the covenant, and read in the audience
           of the people: and they said, All that the LORD hath said will
           we do, and be obedient.

02:024:008 And Moses took the blood, and sprinkled it on the people, and
           said, Behold the blood of the covenant, which the LORD hath
           made with you concerning all these words.

02:024:009 Then went up Moses, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy
           of the elders of Israel:

02:024:010 And they saw the God of Israel: and there was under his feet
           as it were a paved work of a sapphire stone, and as it were
           the body of heaven in his clearness.

02:024:011 And upon the nobles of the children of Israel he laid not his
           hand: also they saw God, and did eat and drink.

02:024:012 And the LORD said unto Moses, Come up to me into the mount,
           and be there: and I will give thee tables of stone, and a law,
           and commandments which I have written; that thou mayest teach
           them.

02:024:013 And Moses rose up, and his minister Joshua: and Moses went up
           into the mount of God.

02:024:014 And he said unto the elders, Tarry ye here for us, until we
           come again unto you: and, behold, Aaron and Hur are with you:
           if any man have any matters to do, let him come unto them.

02:024:015 And Moses went up into the mount, and a cloud covered the
           mount.

02:024:016 And the glory of the LORD abode upon mount Sinai, and the
           cloud covered it six days: and the seventh day he called unto
           Moses out of the midst of the cloud.

02:024:017 And the sight of the glory of the LORD was like devouring fire
           on the top of the mount in the eyes of the children of Israel.

02:024:018 And Moses went into the midst of the cloud, and gat him up
           into the mount: and Moses was in the mount forty days and
           forty nights.

02:025:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

02:025:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, that they bring me an
           offering: of every man that giveth it willingly with his heart
           ye shall take my offering.

02:025:003 And this is the offering which ye shall take of them; gold,
           and silver, and brass,

02:025:004 And blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats'
           hair,

02:025:005 And rams' skins dyed red, and badgers' skins, and shittim
           wood,

02:025:006 Oil for the light, spices for anointing oil, and for sweet
           incense,

02:025:007 Onyx stones, and stones to be set in the ephod, and in the
           breastplate.

02:025:008 And let them make me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among them.

02:025:009 According to all that I shew thee, after the pattern of the
           tabernacle, and the pattern of all the instruments thereof,
           even so shall ye make it.

02:025:010 And they shall make an ark of shittim wood: two cubits and a
           half shall be the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the
           breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof.

02:025:011 And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, within and without
           shalt thou overlay it, and shalt make upon it a crown of gold
           round about.

02:025:012 And thou shalt cast four rings of gold for it, and put them in
           the four corners thereof; and two rings shall be in the one
           side of it, and two rings in the other side of it.

02:025:013 And thou shalt make staves of shittim wood, and overlay them
           with gold.

02:025:014 And thou shalt put the staves into the rings by the sides of
           the ark, that the ark may be borne with them.

02:025:015 The staves shall be in the rings of the ark: they shall not be
           taken from it.

02:025:016 And thou shalt put into the ark the testimony which I shall
           give thee.

02:025:017 And thou shalt make a mercy seat of pure gold: two cubits and
           a half shall be the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the
           breadth thereof.

02:025:018 And thou shalt make two cherubims of gold, of beaten work
           shalt thou make them, in the two ends of the mercy seat.

02:025:019 And make one cherub on the one end, and the other cherub on
           the other end: even of the mercy seat shall ye make the
           cherubims on the two ends thereof.

02:025:020 And the cherubims shall stretch forth their wings on high,
           covering the mercy seat with their wings, and their faces
           shall look one to another; toward the mercy seat shall the
           faces of the cherubims be.

02:025:021 And thou shalt put the mercy seat above upon the ark; and in
           the ark thou shalt put the testimony that I shall give thee.

02:025:022 And there I will meet with thee, and I will commune with thee
           from above the mercy seat, from between the two cherubims
           which are upon the ark of the testimony, of all things which I
           will give thee in commandment unto the children of Israel.

02:025:023 Thou shalt also make a table of shittim wood: two cubits shall
           be the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, and a
           cubit and a half the height thereof.

02:025:024 And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, and make thereto a
           crown of gold round about.

02:025:025 And thou shalt make unto it a border of an hand breadth round
           about, and thou shalt make a golden crown to the border
           thereof round about.

02:025:026 And thou shalt make for it four rings of gold, and put the
           rings in the four corners that are on the four feet thereof.

02:025:027 Over against the border shall the rings be for places of the
           staves to bear the table.

02:025:028 And thou shalt make the staves of shittim wood, and overlay
           them with gold, that the table may be borne with them.

02:025:029 And thou shalt make the dishes thereof, and spoons thereof,
           and covers thereof, and bowls thereof, to cover withal: of
           pure gold shalt thou make them.

02:025:030 And thou shalt set upon the table shewbread before me alway.

02:025:031 And thou shalt make a candlestick of pure gold: of beaten work
           shall the candlestick be made: his shaft, and his branches,
           his bowls, his knops, and his flowers, shall be of the same.

02:025:032 And six branches shall come out of the sides of it; three
           branches of the candlestick out of the one side, and three
           branches of the candlestick out of the other side:

02:025:033 Three bowls made like unto almonds, with a knop and a flower
           in one branch; and three bowls made like almonds in the other
           branch, with a knop and a flower: so in the six branches that
           come out of the candlestick.

02:025:034 And in the candlesticks shall be four bowls made like unto
           almonds, with their knops and their flowers.

02:025:035 And there shall be a knop under two branches of the same, and
           a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under two
           branches of the same, according to the six branches that
           proceed out of the candlestick.

02:025:036 Their knops and their branches shall be of the same: all it
           shall be one beaten work of pure gold.

02:025:037 And thou shalt make the seven lamps thereof: and they shall
           light the lamps thereof, that they may give light over against
           it.

02:025:038 And the tongs thereof, and the snuffdishes thereof, shall be
           of pure gold.

02:025:039 Of a talent of pure gold shall he make it, with all these
           vessels.

02:025:040 And look that thou make them after their pattern, which was
           shewed thee in the mount.

02:026:001 Moreover thou shalt make the tabernacle with ten curtains of
           fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet: with
           cherubims of cunning work shalt thou make them.

02:026:002 The length of one curtain shall be eight and twenty cubits,
           and the breadth of one curtain four cubits: and every one of
           the curtains shall have one measure.

02:026:003 The five curtains shall be coupled together one to another;
           and other five curtains shall be coupled one to another.

02:026:004 And thou shalt make loops of blue upon the edge of the one
           curtain from the selvedge in the coupling; and likewise shalt
           thou make in the uttermost edge of another curtain, in the
           coupling of the second.

02:026:005 Fifty loops shalt thou make in the one curtain, and fifty
           loops shalt thou make in the edge of the curtain that is in
           the coupling of the second; that the loops may take hold one
           of another.

02:026:006 And thou shalt make fifty taches of gold, and couple the
           curtains together with the taches: and it shall be one
           tabernacle.

02:026:007 And thou shalt make curtains of goats' hair to be a covering
           upon the tabernacle: eleven curtains shalt thou make.

02:026:008 The length of one curtain shall be thirty cubits, and the
           breadth of one curtain four cubits: and the eleven curtains
           shall be all of one measure.

02:026:009 And thou shalt couple five curtains by themselves, and six
           curtains by themselves, and shalt double the sixth curtain in
           the forefront of the tabernacle.

02:026:010 And thou shalt make fifty loops on the edge of the one curtain
           that is outmost in the coupling, and fifty loops in the edge
           of the curtain which coupleth the second.

02:026:011 And thou shalt make fifty taches of brass, and put the taches
           into the loops, and couple the tent together, that it may be
           one.

02:026:012 And the remnant that remaineth of the curtains of the tent,
           the half curtain that remaineth, shall hang over the backside
           of the tabernacle.

02:026:013 And a cubit on the one side, and a cubit on the other side of
           that which remaineth in the length of the curtains of the
           tent, it shall hang over the sides of the tabernacle on this
           side and on that side, to cover it.

02:026:014 And thou shalt make a covering for the tent of rams' skins
           dyed red, and a covering above of badgers' skins.

02:026:015 And thou shalt make boards for the tabernacle of shittim wood
           standing up.

02:026:016 Ten cubits shall be the length of a board, and a cubit and a
           half shall be the breadth of one board.

02:026:017 Two tenons shall there be in one board, set in order one
           against another: thus shalt thou make for all the boards of
           the tabernacle.

02:026:018 And thou shalt make the boards for the tabernacle, twenty
           boards on the south side southward.

02:026:019 And thou shalt make forty sockets of silver under the twenty
           boards; two sockets under one board for his two tenons, and
           two sockets under another board for his two tenons.

02:026:020 And for the second side of the tabernacle on the north side
           there shall be twenty boards:

02:026:021 And their forty sockets of silver; two sockets under one
           board, and two sockets under another board.

02:026:022 And for the sides of the tabernacle westward thou shalt make
           six boards.

02:026:023 And two boards shalt thou make for the corners of the
           tabernacle in the two sides.

02:026:024 And they shall be coupled together beneath, and they shall be
           coupled together above the head of it unto one ring: thus
           shall it be for them both; they shall be for the two corners.

02:026:025 And they shall be eight boards, and their sockets of silver,
           sixteen sockets; two sockets under one board, and two sockets
           under another board.

02:026:026 And thou shalt make bars of shittim wood; five for the boards
           of the one side of the tabernacle,

02:026:027 And five bars for the boards of the other side of the
           tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the side of the
           tabernacle, for the two sides westward.

02:026:028 And the middle bar in the midst of the boards shall reach from
           end to end.

02:026:029 And thou shalt overlay the boards with gold, and make their
           rings of gold for places for the bars: and thou shalt overlay
           the bars with gold.

02:026:030 And thou shalt rear up the tabernacle according to the fashion
           thereof which was shewed thee in the mount.

02:026:031 And thou shalt make a vail of blue, and purple, and scarlet,
           and fine twined linen of cunning work: with cherubims shall it
           be made:

02:026:032 And thou shalt hang it upon four pillars of shittim wood
           overlaid with gold: their hooks shall be of gold, upon the
           four sockets of silver.

02:026:033 And thou shalt hang up the vail under the taches, that thou
           mayest bring in thither within the vail the ark of the
           testimony: and the vail shall divide unto you between the holy
           place and the most holy.

02:026:034 And thou shalt put the mercy seat upon the ark of the
           testimony in the most holy place.

02:026:035 And thou shalt set the table without the vail, and the
           candlestick over against the table on the side of the
           tabernacle toward the south: and thou shalt put the table on
           the north side.

02:026:036 And thou shalt make an hanging for the door of the tent, of
           blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, wrought
           with needlework.

02:026:037 And thou shalt make for the hanging five pillars of shittim
           wood, and overlay them with gold, and their hooks shall be of
           gold: and thou shalt cast five sockets of brass for them.

02:027:001 And thou shalt make an altar of shittim wood, five cubits
           long, and five cubits broad; the altar shall be foursquare:
           and the height thereof shall be three cubits.

02:027:002 And thou shalt make the horns of it upon the four corners
           thereof: his horns shall be of the same: and thou shalt
           overlay it with brass.

02:027:003 And thou shalt make his pans to receive his ashes, and his
           shovels, and his basons, and his fleshhooks, and his firepans:
           all the vessels thereof thou shalt make of brass.

02:027:004 And thou shalt make for it a grate of network of brass; and
           upon the net shalt thou make four brasen rings in the four
           corners thereof.

02:027:005 And thou shalt put it under the compass of the altar beneath,
           that the net may be even to the midst of the altar.

02:027:006 And thou shalt make staves for the altar, staves of shittim
           wood, and overlay them with brass.

02:027:007 And the staves shall be put into the rings, and the staves
           shall be upon the two sides of the altar, to bear it.

02:027:008 Hollow with boards shalt thou make it: as it was shewed thee
           in the mount, so shall they make it.

02:027:009 And thou shalt make the court of the tabernacle: for the south
           side southward there shall be hangings for the court of fine
           twined linen of an hundred cubits long for one side:

02:027:010 And the twenty pillars thereof and their twenty sockets shall
           be of brass; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets shall
           be of silver.

02:027:011 And likewise for the north side in length there shall be
           hangings of an hundred cubits long, and his twenty pillars and
           their twenty sockets of brass; the hooks of the pillars and
           their fillets of silver.

02:027:012 And for the breadth of the court on the west side shall be
           hangings of fifty cubits: their pillars ten, and their sockets
           ten.

02:027:013 And the breadth of the court on the east side eastward shall
           be fifty cubits.

02:027:014 The hangings of one side of the gate shall be fifteen cubits:
           their pillars three, and their sockets three.

02:027:015 And on the other side shall be hangings fifteen cubits: their
           pillars three, and their sockets three.

02:027:016 And for the gate of the court shall be an hanging of twenty
           cubits, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined
           linen, wrought with needlework: and their pillars shall be
           four, and their sockets four.

02:027:017 All the pillars round about the court shall be filleted with
           silver; their hooks shall be of silver, and their sockets of
           brass.

02:027:018 The length of the court shall be an hundred cubits, and the
           breadth fifty every where, and the height five cubits of fine
           twined linen, and their sockets of brass.

02:027:019 All the vessels of the tabernacle in all the service thereof,
           and all the pins thereof, and all the pins of the court, shall
           be of brass.

02:027:020 And thou shalt command the children of Israel, that they bring
           thee pure oil olive beaten for the light, to cause the lamp to
           burn always.

02:027:021 In the tabernacle of the congregation without the vail, which
           is before the testimony, Aaron and his sons shall order it
           from evening to morning before the LORD: it shall be a statute
           for ever unto their generations on the behalf of the children
           of Israel.

02:028:001 And take thou unto thee Aaron thy brother, and his sons with
           him, from among the children of Israel, that he may minister
           unto me in the priest's office, even Aaron, Nadab and Abihu,
           Eleazar and Ithamar, Aaron's sons.

02:028:002 And thou shalt make holy garments for Aaron thy brother for
           glory and for beauty.

02:028:003 And thou shalt speak unto all that are wise hearted, whom I
           have filled with the spirit of wisdom, that they may make
           Aaron's garments to consecrate him, that he may minister unto
           me in the priest's office.

02:028:004 And these are the garments which they shall make; a
           breastplate, and an ephod, and a robe, and a broidered coat, a
           mitre, and a girdle: and they shall make holy garments for
           Aaron thy brother, and his sons, that he may minister unto me
           in the priest's office.

02:028:005 And they shall take gold, and blue, and purple, and scarlet,
           and fine linen.

02:028:006 And they shall make the ephod of gold, of blue, and of purple,
           of scarlet, and fine twined linen, with cunning work.

02:028:007 It shall have the two shoulderpieces thereof joined at the two
           edges thereof; and so it shall be joined together.

02:028:008 And the curious girdle of the ephod, which is upon it, shall
           be of the same, according to the work thereof; even of gold,
           of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen.

02:028:009 And thou shalt take two onyx stones, and grave on them the
           names of the children of Israel:

02:028:010 Six of their names on one stone, and the other six names of
           the rest on the other stone, according to their birth.

02:028:011 With the work of an engraver in stone, like the engravings of
           a signet, shalt thou engrave the two stones with the names of
           the children of Israel: thou shalt make them to be set in
           ouches of gold.

02:028:012 And thou shalt put the two stones upon the shoulders of the
           ephod for stones of memorial unto the children of Israel: and
           Aaron shall bear their names before the LORD upon his two
           shoulders for a memorial.

02:028:013 And thou shalt make ouches of gold;

02:028:014 And two chains of pure gold at the ends; of wreathen work
           shalt thou make them, and fasten the wreathen chains to the
           ouches.

02:028:015 And thou shalt make the breastplate of judgment with cunning
           work; after the work of the ephod thou shalt make it; of gold,
           of blue, and of purple, and of scarlet, and of fine twined
           linen, shalt thou make it.

02:028:016 Foursquare it shall be being doubled; a span shall be the
           length thereof, and a span shall be the breadth thereof.

02:028:017 And thou shalt set in it settings of stones, even four rows of
           stones: the first row shall be a sardius, a topaz, and a
           carbuncle: this shall be the first row.

02:028:018 And the second row shall be an emerald, a sapphire, and a
           diamond.

02:028:019 And the third row a ligure, an agate, and an amethyst.

02:028:020 And the fourth row a beryl, and an onyx, and a jasper: they
           shall be set in gold in their inclosings.

02:028:021 And the stones shall be with the names of the children of
           Israel, twelve, according to their names, like the engravings
           of a signet; every one with his name shall they be according
           to the twelve tribes.

02:028:022 And thou shalt make upon the breastplate chains at the ends of
           wreathen work of pure gold.

02:028:023 And thou shalt make upon the breastplate two rings of gold,
           and shalt put the two rings on the two ends of the
           breastplate.

02:028:024 And thou shalt put the two wreathen chains of gold in the two
           rings which are on the ends of the breastplate.

02:028:025 And the other two ends of the two wreathen chains thou shalt
           fasten in the two ouches, and put them on the shoulderpieces
           of the ephod before it.

02:028:026 And thou shalt make two rings of gold, and thou shalt put them
           upon the two ends of the breastplate in the border thereof,
           which is in the side of the ephod inward.

02:028:027 And two other rings of gold thou shalt make, and shalt put
           them on the two sides of the ephod underneath, toward the
           forepart thereof, over against the other coupling thereof,
           above the curious girdle of the ephod.

02:028:028 And they shall bind the breastplate by the rings thereof unto
           the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue, that it may be
           above the curious girdle of the ephod, and that the
           breastplate be not loosed from the ephod.

02:028:029 And Aaron shall bear the names of the children of Israel in
           the breastplate of judgment upon his heart, when he goeth in
           unto the holy place, for a memorial before the LORD
           continually.

02:028:030 And thou shalt put in the breastplate of judgment the Urim and
           the Thummim; and they shall be upon Aaron's heart, when he
           goeth in before the LORD: and Aaron shall bear the judgment of
           the children of Israel upon his heart before the LORD
           continually.

02:028:031 And thou shalt make the robe of the ephod all of blue.

02:028:032 And there shall be an hole in the top of it, in the midst
           thereof: it shall have a binding of woven work round about the
           hole of it, as it were the hole of an habergeon, that it be
           not rent.

02:028:033 And beneath upon the hem of it thou shalt make pomegranates of
           blue, and of purple, and of scarlet, round about the hem
           thereof; and bells of gold between them round about:

02:028:034 A golden bell and a pomegranate, a golden bell and a
           pomegranate, upon the hem of the robe round about.

02:028:035 And it shall be upon Aaron to minister: and his sound shall be
           heard when he goeth in unto the holy place before the LORD,
           and when he cometh out, that he die not.

02:028:036 And thou shalt make a plate of pure gold, and grave upon it,
           like the engravings of a signet, HOLINESS TO THE LORD.

02:028:037 And thou shalt put it on a blue lace, that it may be upon the
           mitre; upon the forefront of the mitre it shall be.

02:028:038 And it shall be upon Aaron's forehead, that Aaron may bear the
           iniquity of the holy things, which the children of Israel
           shall hallow in all their holy gifts; and it shall be always
           upon his forehead, that they may be accepted before the LORD.

02:028:039 And thou shalt embroider the coat of fine linen, and thou
           shalt make the mitre of fine linen, and thou shalt make the
           girdle of needlework.

02:028:040 And for Aaron's sons thou shalt make coats, and thou shalt
           make for them girdles, and bonnets shalt thou make for them,
           for glory and for beauty.

02:028:041 And thou shalt put them upon Aaron thy brother, and his sons
           with him; and shalt anoint them, and consecrate them, and
           sanctify them, that they may minister unto me in the priest's
           office.

02:028:042 And thou shalt make them linen breeches to cover their
           nakedness; from the loins even unto the thighs they shall
           reach:

02:028:043 And they shall be upon Aaron, and upon his sons, when they
           come in unto the tabernacle of the congregation, or when they
           come near unto the altar to minister in the holy place; that
           they bear not iniquity, and die: it shall be a statute for
           ever unto him and his seed after him.

02:029:001 And this is the thing that thou shalt do unto them to hallow
           them, to minister unto me in the priest's office: Take one
           young bullock, and two rams without blemish,

02:029:002 And unleavened bread, and cakes unleavened tempered with oil,
           and wafers unleavened anointed with oil: of wheaten flour
           shalt thou make them.

02:029:003 And thou shalt put them into one basket, and bring them in the
           basket, with the bullock and the two rams.

02:029:004 And Aaron and his sons thou shalt bring unto the door of the
           tabernacle of the congregation, and shalt wash them with
           water.

02:029:005 And thou shalt take the garments, and put upon Aaron the coat,
           and the robe of the ephod, and the ephod, and the breastplate,
           and gird him with the curious girdle of the ephod:

02:029:006 And thou shalt put the mitre upon his head, and put the holy
           crown upon the mitre.

02:029:007 Then shalt thou take the anointing oil, and pour it upon his
           head, and anoint him.

02:029:008 And thou shalt bring his sons, and put coats upon them.

02:029:009 And thou shalt gird them with girdles, Aaron and his sons, and
           put the bonnets on them: and the priest's office shall be
           theirs for a perpetual statute: and thou shalt consecrate
           Aaron and his sons.

02:029:010 And thou shalt cause a bullock to be brought before the
           tabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron and his sons shall
           put their hands upon the head of the bullock.

02:029:011 And thou shalt kill the bullock before the LORD, by the door
           of the tabernacle of the congregation.

02:029:012 And thou shalt take of the blood of the bullock, and put it
           upon the horns of the altar with thy finger, and pour all the
           blood beside the bottom of the altar.

02:029:013 And thou shalt take all the fat that covereth the inwards, and
           the caul that is above the liver, and the two kidneys, and the
           fat that is upon them, and burn them upon the altar.

02:029:014 But the flesh of the bullock, and his skin, and his dung,
           shalt thou burn with fire without the camp: it is a sin
           offering.

02:029:015 Thou shalt also take one ram; and Aaron and his sons shall put
           their hands upon the head of the ram.

02:029:016 And thou shalt slay the ram, and thou shalt take his blood,
           and sprinkle it round about upon the altar.

02:029:017 And thou shalt cut the ram in pieces, and wash the inwards of
           him, and his legs, and put them unto his pieces, and unto his
           head.

02:029:018 And thou shalt burn the whole ram upon the altar: it is a
           burnt offering unto the LORD: it is a sweet savour, an
           offering made by fire unto the LORD.

02:029:019 And thou shalt take the other ram; and Aaron and his sons
           shall put their hands upon the head of the ram.

02:029:020 Then shalt thou kill the ram, and take of his blood, and put
           it upon the tip of the right ear of Aaron, and upon the tip of
           the right ear of his sons, and upon the thumb of their right
           hand, and upon the great toe of their right foot, and sprinkle
           the blood upon the altar round about.

02:029:021 And thou shalt take of the blood that is upon the altar, and
           of the anointing oil, and sprinkle it upon Aaron, and upon his
           garments, and upon his sons, and upon the garments of his sons
           with him: and he shall be hallowed, and his garments, and his
           sons, and his sons' garments with him.

02:029:022 Also thou shalt take of the ram the fat and the rump, and the
           fat that covereth the inwards, and the caul above the liver,
           and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, and the
           right shoulder; for it is a ram of consecration:

02:029:023 And one loaf of bread, and one cake of oiled bread, and one
           wafer out of the basket of the unleavened bread that is before
           the LORD:

02:029:024 And thou shalt put all in the hands of Aaron, and in the hands
           of his sons; and shalt wave them for a wave offering before
           the LORD.

02:029:025 And thou shalt receive them of their hands, and burn them upon
           the altar for a burnt offering, for a sweet savour before the
           LORD: it is an offering made by fire unto the LORD.

02:029:026 And thou shalt take the breast of the ram of Aaron's
           consecration, and wave it for a wave offering before the LORD:
           and it shall be thy part.

02:029:027 And thou shalt sanctify the breast of the wave offering, and
           the shoulder of the heave offering, which is waved, and which
           is heaved up, of the ram of the consecration, even of that
           which is for Aaron, and of that which is for his sons:

02:029:028 And it shall be Aaron's and his sons' by a statute for ever
           from the children of Israel: for it is an heave offering: and
           it shall be an heave offering from the children of Israel of
           the sacrifice of their peace offerings, even their heave
           offering unto the LORD.

02:029:029 And the holy garments of Aaron shall be his sons' after him,
           to be anointed therein, and to be consecrated in them.

02:029:030 And that son that is priest in his stead shall put them on
           seven days, when he cometh into the tabernacle of the
           congregation to minister in the holy place.

02:029:031 And thou shalt take the ram of the consecration, and seethe
           his flesh in the holy place.

02:029:032 And Aaron and his sons shall eat the flesh of the ram, and the
           bread that is in the basket by the door of the tabernacle of
           the congregation.

02:029:033 And they shall eat those things wherewith the atonement was
           made, to consecrate and to sanctify them: but a stranger shall
           not eat thereof, because they are holy.

02:029:034 And if ought of the flesh of the consecrations, or of the
           bread, remain unto the morning, then thou shalt burn the
           remainder with fire: it shall not be eaten, because it is
           holy.

02:029:035 And thus shalt thou do unto Aaron, and to his sons, according
           to all things which I have commanded thee: seven days shalt
           thou consecrate them.

02:029:036 And thou shalt offer every day a bullock for a sin offering
           for atonement: and thou shalt cleanse the altar, when thou
           hast made an atonement for it, and thou shalt anoint it, to
           sanctify it.

02:029:037 Seven days thou shalt make an atonement for the altar, and
           sanctify it; and it shall be an altar most holy: whatsoever
           toucheth the altar shall be holy.

02:029:038 Now this is that which thou shalt offer upon the altar; two
           lambs of the first year day by day continually.

02:029:039 The one lamb thou shalt offer in the morning; and the other
           lamb thou shalt offer at even:

02:029:040 And with the one lamb a tenth deal of flour mingled with the
           fourth part of an hin of beaten oil; and the fourth part of an
           hin of wine for a drink offering.

02:029:041 And the other lamb thou shalt offer at even, and shalt do
           thereto according to the meat offering of the morning, and
           according to the drink offering thereof, for a sweet savour,
           an offering made by fire unto the LORD.

02:029:042 This shall be a continual burnt offering throughout your
           generations at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation
           before the LORD: where I will meet you, to speak there unto
           thee.

02:029:043 And there I will meet with the children of Israel, and the
           tabernacle shall be sanctified by my glory.

02:029:044 And I will sanctify the tabernacle of the congregation, and
           the altar: I will sanctify also both Aaron and his sons, to
           minister to me in the priest's office.

02:029:045 And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will be
           their God.

02:029:046 And they shall know that I am the LORD their God, that brought
           them forth out of the land of Egypt, that I may dwell among
           them: I am the LORD their God.

02:030:001 And thou shalt make an altar to burn incense upon: of shittim
           wood shalt thou make it.

02:030:002 A cubit shall be the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth
           thereof; foursquare shall it be: and two cubits shall be the
           height thereof: the horns thereof shall be of the same.

02:030:003 And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, the top thereof, and
           the sides thereof round about, and the horns thereof; and thou
           shalt make unto it a crown of gold round about.

02:030:004 And two golden rings shalt thou make to it under the crown of
           it, by the two corners thereof, upon the two sides of it shalt
           thou make it; and they shall be for places for the staves to
           bear it withal.

02:030:005 And thou shalt make the staves of shittim wood, and overlay
           them with gold.

02:030:006 And thou shalt put it before the vail that is by the ark of
           the testimony, before the mercy seat that is over the
           testimony, where I will meet with thee.

02:030:007 And Aaron shall burn thereon sweet incense every morning: when
           he dresseth the lamps, he shall burn incense upon it.

02:030:008 And when Aaron lighteth the lamps at even, he shall burn
           incense upon it, a perpetual incense before the LORD
           throughout your generations.

02:030:009 Ye shall offer no strange incense thereon, nor burnt
           sacrifice, nor meat offering; neither shall ye pour drink
           offering thereon.

02:030:010 And Aaron shall make an atonement upon the horns of it once in
           a year with the blood of the sin offering of atonements: once
           in the year shall he make atonement upon it throughout your
           generations: it is most holy unto the LORD.

02:030:011 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

02:030:012 When thou takest the sum of the children of Israel after their
           number, then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul
           unto the LORD, when thou numberest them; that there be no
           plague among them, when thou numberest them.

02:030:013 This they shall give, every one that passeth among them that
           are numbered, half a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary:
           (a shekel is twenty gerahs:) an half shekel shall be the
           offering of the LORD.

02:030:014 Every one that passeth among them that are numbered, from
           twenty years old and above, shall give an offering unto the
           LORD.

02:030:015 The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less
           than half a shekel, when they give an offering unto the LORD,
           to make an atonement for your souls.

02:030:016 And thou shalt take the atonement money of the children of
           Israel, and shalt appoint it for the service of the tabernacle
           of the congregation; that it may be a memorial unto the
           children of Israel before the LORD, to make an atonement for
           your souls.

02:030:017 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

02:030:018 Thou shalt also make a laver of brass, and his foot also of
           brass, to wash withal: and thou shalt put it between the
           tabernacle of the congregation and the altar, and thou shalt
           put water therein.

02:030:019 For Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet
           thereat:

02:030:020 When they go into the tabernacle of the congregation, they
           shall wash with water, that they die not; or when they come
           near to the altar to minister, to burn offering made by fire
           unto the LORD:

02:030:021 So they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they die
           not: and it shall be a statute for ever to them, even to him
           and to his seed throughout their generations.

02:030:022 Moreover the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

02:030:023 Take thou also unto thee principal spices, of pure myrrh five
           hundred shekels, and of sweet cinnamon half so much, even two
           hundred and fifty shekels, and of sweet calamus two hundred
           and fifty shekels,

02:030:024 And of cassia five hundred shekels, after the shekel of the
           sanctuary, and of oil olive an hin:

02:030:025 And thou shalt make it an oil of holy ointment, an ointment
           compound after the art of the apothecary: it shall be an holy
           anointing oil.

02:030:026 And thou shalt anoint the tabernacle of the congregation
           therewith, and the ark of the testimony,

02:030:027 And the table and all his vessels, and the candlestick and his
           vessels, and the altar of incense,

02:030:028 And the altar of burnt offering with all his vessels, and the
           laver and his foot.

02:030:029 And thou shalt sanctify them, that they may be most holy:
           whatsoever toucheth them shall be holy.

02:030:030 And thou shalt anoint Aaron and his sons, and consecrate them,
           that they may minister unto me in the priest's office.

02:030:031 And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, This
           shall be an holy anointing oil unto me throughout your
           generations.

02:030:032 Upon man's flesh shall it not be poured, neither shall ye make
           any other like it, after the composition of it: it is holy,
           and it shall be holy unto you.

02:030:033 Whosoever compoundeth any like it, or whosoever putteth any of
           it upon a stranger, shall even be cut off from his people.

02:030:034 And the LORD said unto Moses, Take unto thee sweet spices,
           stacte, and onycha, and galbanum; these sweet spices with pure
           frankincense: of each shall there be a like weight:

02:030:035 And thou shalt make it a perfume, a confection after the art
           of the apothecary, tempered together, pure and holy:

02:030:036 And thou shalt beat some of it very small, and put of it
           before the testimony in the tabernacle of the congregation,
           where I will meet with thee: it shall be unto you most holy.

02:030:037 And as for the perfume which thou shalt make, ye shall not
           make to yourselves according to the composition thereof: it
           shall be unto thee holy for the LORD.

02:030:038 Whosoever shall make like unto that, to smell thereto, shall
           even be cut off from his people.

02:031:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

02:031:002 See, I have called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of
           Hur, of the tribe of Judah:

02:031:003 And I have filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, and
           in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of
           workmanship,

02:031:004 To devise cunning works, to work in gold, and in silver, and
           in brass,

02:031:005 And in cutting of stones, to set them, and in carving of
           timber, to work in all manner of workmanship.

02:031:006 And I, behold, I have given with him Aholiab, the son of
           Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan: and in the hearts of all that
           are wise hearted I have put wisdom, that they may make all
           that I have commanded thee;

02:031:007 The tabernacle of the congregation, and the ark of the
           testimony, and the mercy seat that is thereupon, and all the
           furniture of the tabernacle,

02:031:008 And the table and his furniture, and the pure candlestick with
           all his furniture, and the altar of incense,

02:031:009 And the altar of burnt offering with all his furniture, and
           the laver and his foot,

02:031:010 And the cloths of service, and the holy garments for Aaron the
           priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the
           priest's office,

02:031:011 And the anointing oil, and sweet incense for the holy place:
           according to all that I have commanded thee shall they do.

02:031:012 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

02:031:013 Speak thou also unto the children of Israel, saying, Verily my
           sabbaths ye shall keep: for it is a sign between me and you
           throughout your generations; that ye may know that I am the
           LORD that doth sanctify you.

02:031:014 Ye shall keep the sabbath therefore; for it is holy unto you:
           every one that defileth it shall surely be put to death: for
           whosoever doeth any work therein, that soul shall be cut off
           from among his people.

02:031:015 Six days may work be done; but in the seventh is the sabbath
           of rest, holy to the LORD: whosoever doeth any work in the
           sabbath day, he shall surely be put to death.

02:031:016 Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to
           observe the sabbath throughout their generations, for a
           perpetual covenant.

02:031:017 It is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever:
           for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, and on the
           seventh day he rested, and was refreshed.

02:031:018 And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing
           with him upon mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, tables of
           stone, written with the finger of God.

02:032:001 And when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out of
           the mount, the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron,
           and said unto him, Up, make us gods, which shall go before us;
           for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the
           land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him.

02:032:002 And Aaron said unto them, Break off the golden earrings, which
           are in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your
           daughters, and bring them unto me.

02:032:003 And all the people brake off the golden earrings which were in
           their ears, and brought them unto Aaron.

02:032:004 And he received them at their hand, and fashioned it with a
           graving tool, after he had made it a molten calf: and they
           said, These be thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out
           of the land of Egypt.

02:032:005 And when Aaron saw it, he built an altar before it; and Aaron
           made proclamation, and said, To morrow is a feast to the LORD.

02:032:006 And they rose up early on the morrow, and offered burnt
           offerings, and brought peace offerings; and the people sat
           down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play.

02:032:007 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go, get thee down; for thy
           people, which thou broughtest out of the land of Egypt, have
           corrupted themselves:

02:032:008 They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I
           commanded them: they have made them a molten calf, and have
           worshipped it, and have sacrificed thereunto, and said, These
           be thy gods, O Israel, which have brought thee up out of the
           land of Egypt.

02:032:009 And the LORD said unto Moses, I have seen this people, and,
           behold, it is a stiffnecked people:

02:032:010 Now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may wax hot against
           them, and that I may consume them: and I will make of thee a
           great nation.

02:032:011 And Moses besought the LORD his God, and said, LORD, why doth
           thy wrath wax hot against thy people, which thou hast brought
           forth out of the land of Egypt with great power, and with a
           mighty hand?

02:032:012 Wherefore should the Egyptians speak, and say, For mischief
           did he bring them out, to slay them in the mountains, and to
           consume them from the face of the earth? Turn from thy fierce
           wrath, and repent of this evil against thy people.

02:032:013 Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom
           thou swarest by thine own self, and saidst unto them, I will
           multiply your seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land
           that I have spoken of will I give unto your seed, and they
           shall inherit it for ever.

02:032:014 And the LORD repented of the evil which he thought to do unto
           his people.

02:032:015 And Moses turned, and went down from the mount, and the two
           tables of the testimony were in his hand: the tables were
           written on both their sides; on the one side and on the other
           were they written.

02:032:016 And the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the
           writing of God, graven upon the tables.

02:032:017 And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted,
           he said unto Moses, There is a noise of war in the camp.

02:032:018 And he said, It is not the voice of them that shout for
           mastery, neither is it the voice of them that cry for being
           overcome: but the noise of them that sing do I hear.

02:032:019 And it came to pass, as soon as he came nigh unto the camp,
           that he saw the calf, and the dancing: and Moses' anger waxed
           hot, and he cast the tables out of his hands, and brake them
           beneath the mount.

02:032:020 And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt it in the
           fire, and ground it to powder, and strawed it upon the water,
           and made the children of Israel drink of it.

02:032:021 And Moses said unto Aaron, What did this people unto thee,
           that thou hast brought so great a sin upon them?

02:032:022 And Aaron said, Let not the anger of my lord wax hot: thou
           knowest the people, that they are set on mischief.

02:032:023 For they said unto me, Make us gods, which shall go before us:
           for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the
           land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him.

02:032:024 And I said unto them, Whosoever hath any gold, let them break
           it off. So they gave it me: then I cast it into the fire, and
           there came out this calf.

02:032:025 And when Moses saw that the people were naked; (for Aaron had
           made them naked unto their shame among their enemies:)

02:032:026 Then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Who is on
           the LORD's side? let him come unto me. And all the sons of
           Levi gathered themselves together unto him.

02:032:027 And he said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Put
           every man his sword by his side, and go in and out from gate
           to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother,
           and every man his companion, and every man his neighbour.

02:032:028 And the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses:
           and there fell of the people that day about three thousand
           men.

02:032:029 For Moses had said, Consecrate yourselves today to the LORD,
           even every man upon his son, and upon his brother; that he may
           bestow upon you a blessing this day.

02:032:030 And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses said unto the
           people, Ye have sinned a great sin: and now I will go up unto
           the LORD; peradventure I shall make an atonement for your sin.

02:032:031 And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, Oh, this people
           have sinned a great sin, and have made them gods of gold.

02:032:032 Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin--; and if not, blot
           me, I pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written.

02:032:033 And the LORD said unto Moses, Whosoever hath sinned against
           me, him will I blot out of my book.

02:032:034 Therefore now go, lead the people unto the place of which I
           have spoken unto thee: behold, mine Angel shall go before
           thee: nevertheless in the day when I visit I will visit their
           sin upon them.

02:032:035 And the LORD plagued the people, because they made the calf,
           which Aaron made.

02:033:001 And the LORD said unto Moses, Depart, and go up hence, thou
           and the people which thou hast brought up out of the land of
           Egypt, unto the land which I sware unto Abraham, to Isaac, and
           to Jacob, saying, Unto thy seed will I give it:

02:033:002 And I will send an angel before thee; and I will drive out the
           Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite,
           the Hivite, and the Jebusite:

02:033:003 Unto a land flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up
           in the midst of thee; for thou art a stiffnecked people: lest
           I consume thee in the way.

02:033:004 And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned:
           and no man did put on him his ornaments.

02:033:005 For the LORD had said unto Moses, Say unto the children of
           Israel, Ye are a stiffnecked people: I will come up into the
           midst of thee in a moment, and consume thee: therefore now put
           off thy ornaments from thee, that I may know what to do unto
           thee.

02:033:006 And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their
           ornaments by the mount Horeb.

02:033:007 And Moses took the tabernacle, and pitched it without the
           camp, afar off from the camp, and called it the Tabernacle of
           the congregation. And it came to pass, that every one which
           sought the LORD went out unto the tabernacle of the
           congregation, which was without the camp.

02:033:008 And it came to pass, when Moses went out unto the tabernacle,
           that all the people rose up, and stood every man at his tent
           door, and looked after Moses, until he was gone into the
           tabernacle.

02:033:009 And it came to pass, as Moses entered into the tabernacle, the
           cloudy pillar descended, and stood at the door of the
           tabernacle, and the Lord talked with Moses.

02:033:010 And all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand at the
           tabernacle door: and all the people rose up and worshipped,
           every man in his tent door.

02:033:011 And the LORD spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh
           unto his friend. And he turned again into the camp: but his
           servant Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out
           of the tabernacle.

02:033:012 And Moses said unto the LORD, See, thou sayest unto me, Bring
           up this people: and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt
           send with me. Yet thou hast said, I know thee by name, and
           thou hast also found grace in my sight.

02:033:013 Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found grace in thy
           sight, shew me now thy way, that I may know thee, that I may
           find grace in thy sight: and consider that this nation is thy
           people.

02:033:014 And he said, My presence shall go with thee, and I will give
           thee rest.

02:033:015 And he said unto him, If thy presence go not with me, carry us
           not up hence.

02:033:016 For wherein shall it be known here that I and thy people have
           found grace in thy sight? is it not in that thou goest with
           us? so shall we be separated, I and thy people, from all the
           people that are upon the face of the earth.

02:033:017 And the LORD said unto Moses, I will do this thing also that
           thou hast spoken: for thou hast found grace in my sight, and I
           know thee by name.

02:033:018 And he said, I beseech thee, shew me thy glory.

02:033:019 And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before thee, and
           I will proclaim the name of the LORD before thee; and will be
           gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will shew mercy on
           whom I will shew mercy.

02:033:020 And he said, Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no
           man see me, and live.

02:033:021 And the LORD said, Behold, there is a place by me, and thou
           shalt stand upon a rock:

02:033:022 And it shall come to pass, while my glory passeth by, that I
           will put thee in a clift of the rock, and will cover thee with
           my hand while I pass by:

02:033:023 And I will take away mine hand, and thou shalt see my back
           parts: but my face shall not be seen.

02:034:001 And the LORD said unto Moses, Hew thee two tables of stone
           like unto the first: and I will write upon these tables the
           words that were in the first tables, which thou brakest.

02:034:002 And be ready in the morning, and come up in the morning unto
           mount Sinai, and present thyself there to me in the top of the
           mount.

02:034:003 And no man shall come up with thee, neither let any man be
           seen throughout all the mount; neither let the flocks nor
           herds feed before that mount.

02:034:004 And he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first; and
           Moses rose up early in the morning, and went up unto mount
           Sinai, as the LORD had commanded him, and took in his hand the
           two tables of stone.

02:034:005 And the LORD descended in the cloud, and stood with him there,
           and proclaimed the name of the LORD.

02:034:006 And the LORD passed by before him, and proclaimed, The LORD,
           The LORD God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and
           abundant in goodness and truth,

02:034:007 Keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and
           transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear the
           guilty; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the
           children, and upon the children's children, unto the third and
           to the fourth generation.

02:034:008 And Moses made haste, and bowed his head toward the earth, and
           worshipped.

02:034:009 And he said, If now I have found grace in thy sight, O LORD,
           let my LORD, I pray thee, go among us; for it is a stiffnecked
           people; and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for
           thine inheritance.

02:034:010 And he said, Behold, I make a covenant: before all thy people
           I will do marvels, such as have not been done in all the
           earth, nor in any nation: and all the people among which thou
           art shall see the work of the LORD: for it is a terrible thing
           that I will do with thee.

02:034:011 Observe thou that which I command thee this day: behold, I
           drive out before thee the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the
           Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite.

02:034:012 Take heed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the
           inhabitants of the land whither thou goest, lest it be for a
           snare in the midst of thee:

02:034:013 But ye shall destroy their altars, break their images, and cut
           down their groves:

02:034:014 For thou shalt worship no other god: for the LORD, whose name
           is Jealous, is a jealous God:

02:034:015 Lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land,
           and they go a whoring after their gods, and do sacrifice unto
           their gods, and one call thee, and thou eat of his sacrifice;

02:034:016 And thou take of their daughters unto thy sons, and their
           daughters go a whoring after their gods, and make thy sons go
           a whoring after their gods.

02:034:017 Thou shalt make thee no molten gods.

02:034:018 The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep. Seven days thou
           shalt eat unleavened bread, as I commanded thee, in the time
           of the month Abib: for in the month Abib thou camest out from
           Egypt.

02:034:019 All that openeth the matrix is mine; and every firstling among
           thy cattle, whether ox or sheep, that is male.

02:034:020 But the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb: and
           if thou redeem him not, then shalt thou break his neck. All
           the firstborn of thy sons thou shalt redeem. And none shall
           appear before me empty.

02:034:021 Six days thou shalt work, but on the seventh day thou shalt
           rest: in earing time and in harvest thou shalt rest.

02:034:022 And thou shalt observe the feast of weeks, of the firstfruits
           of wheat harvest, and the feast of ingathering at the year's
           end.

02:034:023 Thrice in the year shall all your menchildren appear before
           the LORD God, the God of Israel.

02:034:024 For I will cast out the nations before thee, and enlarge thy
           borders: neither shall any man desire thy land, when thou
           shalt go up to appear before the LORD thy God thrice in the
           year.

02:034:025 Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven;
           neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be
           left unto the morning.

02:034:026 The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring unto
           the house of the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in
           his mother's milk.

02:034:027 And the LORD said unto Moses, Write thou these words: for
           after the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with
           thee and with Israel.

02:034:028 And he was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights; he
           did neither eat bread, nor drink water. And he wrote upon the
           tables the words of the covenant, the ten commandments.

02:034:029 And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai
           with the two tables of testimony in Moses' hand, when he came
           down from the mount, that Moses wist not that the skin of his
           face shone while he talked with him.

02:034:030 And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses,
           behold, the skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to
           come nigh him.

02:034:031 And Moses called unto them; and Aaron and all the rulers of
           the congregation returned unto him: and Moses talked with
           them.

02:034:032 And afterward all the children of Israel came nigh: and he
           gave them in commandment all that the LORD had spoken with him
           in mount Sinai.

02:034:033 And till Moses had done speaking with them, he put a vail on
           his face.

02:034:034 But when Moses went in before the LORD to speak with him, he
           took the vail off, until he came out. And he came out, and
           spake unto the children of Israel that which he was commanded.

02:034:035 And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the
           skin of Moses' face shone: and Moses put the vail upon his
           face again, until he went in to speak with him.

02:035:001 And Moses gathered all the congregation of the children of
           Israel together, and said unto them, These are the words which
           the LORD hath commanded, that ye should do them.

02:035:002 Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day there
           shall be to you an holy day, a sabbath of rest to the LORD:
           whosoever doeth work therein shall be put to death.

02:035:003 Ye shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations upon the
           sabbath day.

02:035:004 And Moses spake unto all the congregation of the children of
           Israel, saying, This is the thing which the LORD commanded,
           saying,

02:035:005 Take ye from among you an offering unto the LORD: whosoever is
           of a willing heart, let him bring it, an offering of the LORD;
           gold, and silver, and brass,

02:035:006 And blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats'
           hair,

02:035:007 And rams' skins dyed red, and badgers' skins, and shittim
           wood,

02:035:008 And oil for the light, and spices for anointing oil, and for
           the sweet incense,

02:035:009 And onyx stones, and stones to be set for the ephod, and for
           the breastplate.

02:035:010 And every wise hearted among you shall come, and make all that
           the LORD hath commanded;

02:035:011 The tabernacle, his tent, and his covering, his taches, and
           his boards, his bars, his pillars, and his sockets,

02:035:012 The ark, and the staves thereof, with the mercy seat, and the
           vail of the covering,

02:035:013 The table, and his staves, and all his vessels, and the
           shewbread,

02:035:014 The candlestick also for the light, and his furniture, and his
           lamps, with the oil for the light,

02:035:015 And the incense altar, and his staves, and the anointing oil,
           and the sweet incense, and the hanging for the door at the
           entering in of the tabernacle,

02:035:016 The altar of burnt offering, with his brasen grate, his
           staves, and all his vessels, the laver and his foot,

02:035:017 The hangings of the court, his pillars, and their sockets, and
           the hanging for the door of the court,

02:035:018 The pins of the tabernacle, and the pins of the court, and
           their cords,

02:035:019 The cloths of service, to do service in the holy place, the
           holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his
           sons, to minister in the priest's office.

02:035:020 And all the congregation of the children of Israel departed
           from the presence of Moses.

02:035:021 And they came, every one whose heart stirred him up, and every
           one whom his spirit made willing, and they brought the LORD's
           offering to the work of the tabernacle of the congregation,
           and for all his service, and for the holy garments.

02:035:022 And they came, both men and women, as many as were willing
           hearted, and brought bracelets, and earrings, and rings, and
           tablets, all jewels of gold: and every man that offered
           offered an offering of gold unto the LORD.

02:035:023 And every man, with whom was found blue, and purple, and
           scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' hair, and red skins of
           rams, and badgers' skins, brought them.

02:035:024 Every one that did offer an offering of silver and brass
           brought the LORD's offering: and every man, with whom was
           found shittim wood for any work of the service, brought it.

02:035:025 And all the women that were wise hearted did spin with their
           hands, and brought that which they had spun, both of blue, and
           of purple, and of scarlet, and of fine linen.

02:035:026 And all the women whose heart stirred them up in wisdom spun
           goats' hair.

02:035:027 And the rulers brought onyx stones, and stones to be set, for
           the ephod, and for the breastplate;

02:035:028 And spice, and oil for the light, and for the anointing oil,
           and for the sweet incense.

02:035:029 The children of Israel brought a willing offering unto the
           LORD, every man and woman, whose heart made them willing to
           bring for all manner of work, which the LORD had commanded to
           be made by the hand of Moses.

02:035:030 And Moses said unto the children of Israel, See, the LORD hath
           called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the
           tribe of Judah;

02:035:031 And he hath filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, in
           understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of
           workmanship;

02:035:032 And to devise curious works, to work in gold, and in silver,
           and in brass,

02:035:033 And in the cutting of stones, to set them, and in carving of
           wood, to make any manner of cunning work.

02:035:034 And he hath put in his heart that he may teach, both he, and
           Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan.

02:035:035 Them hath he filled with wisdom of heart, to work all manner
           of work, of the engraver, and of the cunning workman, and of
           the embroiderer, in blue, and in purple, in scarlet, and in
           fine linen, and of the weaver, even of them that do any work,
           and of those that devise cunning work.

02:036:001 Then wrought Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted man,
           in whom the LORD put wisdom and understanding to know how to
           work all manner of work for the service of the sanctuary,
           according to all that the LORD had commanded.

02:036:002 And Moses called Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted
           man, in whose heart the LORD had put wisdom, even every one
           whose heart stirred him up to come unto the work to do it:

02:036:003 And they received of Moses all the offering, which the
           children of Israel had brought for the work of the service of
           the sanctuary, to make it withal. And they brought yet unto
           him free offerings every morning.

02:036:004 And all the wise men, that wrought all the work of the
           sanctuary, came every man from his work which they made;

02:036:005 And they spake unto Moses, saying, The people bring much more
           than enough for the service of the work, which the LORD
           commanded to make.

02:036:006 And Moses gave commandment, and they caused it to be
           proclaimed throughout the camp, saying, Let neither man nor
           woman make any more work for the offering of the sanctuary. So
           the people were restrained from bringing.

02:036:007 For the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make
           it, and too much.

02:036:008 And every wise hearted man among them that wrought the work of
           the tabernacle made ten curtains of fine twined linen, and
           blue, and purple, and scarlet: with cherubims of cunning work
           made he them.

02:036:009 The length of one curtain was twenty and eight cubits, and the
           breadth of one curtain four cubits: the curtains were all of
           one size.

02:036:010 And he coupled the five curtains one unto another: and the
           other five curtains he coupled one unto another.

02:036:011 And he made loops of blue on the edge of one curtain from the
           selvedge in the coupling: likewise he made in the uttermost
           side of another curtain, in the coupling of the second.

02:036:012 Fifty loops made he in one curtain, and fifty loops made he in
           the edge of the curtain which was in the coupling of the
           second: the loops held one curtain to another.

02:036:013 And he made fifty taches of gold, and coupled the curtains one
           unto another with the taches: so it became one tabernacle.

02:036:014 And he made curtains of goats' hair for the tent over the
           tabernacle: eleven curtains he made them.

02:036:015 The length of one curtain was thirty cubits, and four cubits
           was the breadth of one curtain: the eleven curtains were of
           one size.

02:036:016 And he coupled five curtains by themselves, and six curtains
           by themselves.

02:036:017 And he made fifty loops upon the uttermost edge of the curtain
           in the coupling, and fifty loops made he upon the edge of the
           curtain which coupleth the second.

02:036:018 And he made fifty taches of brass to couple the tent together,
           that it might be one.

02:036:019 And he made a covering for the tent of rams' skins dyed red,
           and a covering of badgers' skins above that.

02:036:020 And he made boards for the tabernacle of shittim wood,
           standing up.

02:036:021 The length of a board was ten cubits, and the breadth of a
           board one cubit and a half.

02:036:022 One board had two tenons, equally distant one from another:
           thus did he make for all the boards of the tabernacle.

02:036:023 And he made boards for the tabernacle; twenty boards for the
           south side southward:

02:036:024 And forty sockets of silver he made under the twenty boards;
           two sockets under one board for his two tenons, and two
           sockets under another board for his two tenons.

02:036:025 And for the other side of the tabernacle, which is toward the
           north corner, he made twenty boards,

02:036:026 And their forty sockets of silver; two sockets under one
           board, and two sockets under another board.

02:036:027 And for the sides of the tabernacle westward he made six
           boards.

02:036:028 And two boards made he for the corners of the tabernacle in
           the two sides.

02:036:029 And they were coupled beneath, and coupled together at the
           head thereof, to one ring: thus he did to both of them in both
           the corners.

02:036:030 And there were eight boards; and their sockets were sixteen
           sockets of silver, under every board two sockets.

02:036:031 And he made bars of shittim wood; five for the boards of the
           one side of the tabernacle,

02:036:032 And five bars for the boards of the other side of the
           tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the tabernacle for
           the sides westward.

02:036:033 And he made the middle bar to shoot through the boards from
           the one end to the other.

02:036:034 And he overlaid the boards with gold, and made their rings of
           gold to be places for the bars, and overlaid the bars with
           gold.

02:036:035 And he made a vail of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine
           twined linen: with cherubims made he it of cunning work.

02:036:036 And he made thereunto four pillars of shittim wood, and
           overlaid them with gold: their hooks were of gold; and he cast
           for them four sockets of silver.

02:036:037 And he made an hanging for the tabernacle door of blue, and
           purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, of needlework;

02:036:038 And the five pillars of it with their hooks: and he overlaid
           their chapiters and their fillets with gold: but their five
           sockets were of brass.

02:037:001 And Bezaleel made the ark of shittim wood: two cubits and a
           half was the length of it, and a cubit and a half the breadth
           of it, and a cubit and a half the height of it:

02:037:002 And he overlaid it with pure gold within and without, and made
           a crown of gold to it round about.

02:037:003 And he cast for it four rings of gold, to be set by the four
           corners of it; even two rings upon the one side of it, and two
           rings upon the other side of it.

02:037:004 And he made staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with
           gold.

02:037:005 And he put the staves into the rings by the sides of the ark,
           to bear the ark.

02:037:006 And he made the mercy seat of pure gold: two cubits and a half
           was the length thereof, and one cubit and a half the breadth
           thereof.

02:037:007 And he made two cherubims of gold, beaten out of one piece
           made he them, on the two ends of the mercy seat;

02:037:008 One cherub on the end on this side, and another cherub on the
           other end on that side: out of the mercy seat made he the
           cherubims on the two ends thereof.

02:037:009 And the cherubims spread out their wings on high, and covered
           with their wings over the mercy seat, with their faces one to
           another; even to the mercy seatward were the faces of the
           cherubims.

02:037:010 And he made the table of shittim wood: two cubits was the
           length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, and a cubit
           and a half the height thereof:

02:037:011 And he overlaid it with pure gold, and made thereunto a crown
           of gold round about.

02:037:012 Also he made thereunto a border of an handbreadth round about;
           and made a crown of gold for the border thereof round about.

02:037:013 And he cast for it four rings of gold, and put the rings upon
           the four corners that were in the four feet thereof.

02:037:014 Over against the border were the rings, the places for the
           staves to bear the table.

02:037:015 And he made the staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with
           gold, to bear the table.

02:037:016 And he made the vessels which were upon the table, his dishes,
           and his spoons, and his bowls, and his covers to cover withal,
           of pure gold.

02:037:017 And he made the candlestick of pure gold: of beaten work made
           he the candlestick; his shaft, and his branch, his bowls, his
           knops, and his flowers, were of the same:

02:037:018 And six branches going out of the sides thereof; three
           branches of the candlestick out of the one side thereof, and
           three branches of the candlestick out of the other side
           thereof:

02:037:019 Three bowls made after the fashion of almonds in one branch, a
           knop and a flower; and three bowls made like almonds in
           another branch, a knop and a flower: so throughout the six
           branches going out of the candlestick.

02:037:020 And in the candlestick were four bowls made like almonds, his
           knops, and his flowers:

02:037:021 And a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under
           two branches of the same, and a knop under two branches of the
           same, according to the six branches going out of it.

02:037:022 Their knops and their branches were of the same: all of it was
           one beaten work of pure gold.

02:037:023 And he made his seven lamps, and his snuffers, and his
           snuffdishes, of pure gold.

02:037:024 Of a talent of pure gold made he it, and all the vessels
           thereof.

02:037:025 And he made the incense altar of shittim wood: the length of
           it was a cubit, and the breadth of it a cubit; it was
           foursquare; and two cubits was the height of it; the horns
           thereof were of the same.

02:037:026 And he overlaid it with pure gold, both the top of it, and the
           sides thereof round about, and the horns of it: also he made
           unto it a crown of gold round about.

02:037:027 And he made two rings of gold for it under the crown thereof,
           by the two corners of it, upon the two sides thereof, to be
           places for the staves to bear it withal.

02:037:028 And he made the staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with
           gold.

02:037:029 And he made the holy anointing oil, and the pure incense of
           sweet spices, according to the work of the apothecary.

02:038:001 And he made the altar of burnt offering of shittim wood: five
           cubits was the length thereof, and five cubits the breadth
           thereof; it was foursquare; and three cubits the height
           thereof.

02:038:002 And he made the horns thereof on the four corners of it; the
           horns thereof were of the same: and he overlaid it with brass.

02:038:003 And he made all the vessels of the altar, the pots, and the
           shovels, and the basons, and the fleshhooks, and the firepans:
           all the vessels thereof made he of brass.

02:038:004 And he made for the altar a brasen grate of network under the
           compass thereof beneath unto the midst of it.

02:038:005 And he cast four rings for the four ends of the grate of
           brass, to be places for the staves.

02:038:006 And he made the staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with
           brass.

02:038:007 And he put the staves into the rings on the sides of the
           altar, to bear it withal; he made the altar hollow with
           boards.

02:038:008 And he made the laver of brass, and the foot of it of brass,
           of the lookingglasses of the women assembling, which assembled
           at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.

02:038:009 And he made the court: on the south side southward the
           hangings of the court were of fine twined linen, an hundred
           cubits:

02:038:010 Their pillars were twenty, and their brasen sockets twenty;
           the hooks of the pillars and their fillets were of silver.

02:038:011 And for the north side the hangings were an hundred cubits,
           their pillars were twenty, and their sockets of brass twenty;
           the hooks of the pillars and their fillets of silver.

02:038:012 And for the west side were hangings of fifty cubits, their
           pillars ten, and their sockets ten; the hooks of the pillars
           and their fillets of silver.

02:038:013 And for the east side eastward fifty cubits.

02:038:014 The hangings of the one side of the gate were fifteen cubits;
           their pillars three, and their sockets three.

02:038:015 And for the other side of the court gate, on this hand and
           that hand, were hangings of fifteen cubits; their pillars
           three, and their sockets three.

02:038:016 All the hangings of the court round about were of fine twined
           linen.

02:038:017 And the sockets for the pillars were of brass; the hooks of
           the pillars and their fillets of silver; and the overlaying of
           their chapiters of silver; and all the pillars of the court
           were filleted with silver.

02:038:018 And the hanging for the gate of the court was needlework, of
           blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen: and
           twenty cubits was the length, and the height in the breadth
           was five cubits, answerable to the hangings of the court.

02:038:019 And their pillars were four, and their sockets of brass four;
           their hooks of silver, and the overlaying of their chapiters
           and their fillets of silver.

02:038:020 And all the pins of the tabernacle, and of the court round
           about, were of brass.

02:038:021 This is the sum of the tabernacle, even of the tabernacle of
           testimony, as it was counted, according to the commandment of
           Moses, for the service of the Levites, by the hand of Ithamar,
           son to Aaron the priest.

02:038:022 And Bezaleel the son Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of
           Judah, made all that the LORD commanded Moses.

02:038:023 And with him was Aholiab, son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of
           Dan, an engraver, and a cunning workman, and an embroiderer in
           blue, and in purple, and in scarlet, and fine linen.

02:038:024 All the gold that was occupied for the work in all the work of
           the holy place, even the gold of the offering, was twenty and
           nine talents, and seven hundred and thirty shekels, after the
           shekel of the sanctuary.

02:038:025 And the silver of them that were numbered of the congregation
           was an hundred talents, and a thousand seven hundred and
           threescore and fifteen shekels, after the shekel of the
           sanctuary:

02:038:026 A bekah for every man, that is, half a shekel, after the
           shekel of the sanctuary, for every one that went to be
           numbered, from twenty years old and upward, for six hundred
           thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty men.

02:038:027 And of the hundred talents of silver were cast the sockets of
           the sanctuary, and the sockets of the vail; an hundred sockets
           of the hundred talents, a talent for a socket.

02:038:028 And of the thousand seven hundred seventy and five shekels he
           made hooks for the pillars, and overlaid their chapiters, and
           filleted them.

02:038:029 And the brass of the offering was seventy talents, and two
           thousand and four hundred shekels.

02:038:030 And therewith he made the sockets to the door of the
           tabernacle of the congregation, and the brasen altar, and the
           brasen grate for it, and all the vessels of the altar,

02:038:031 And the sockets of the court round about, and the sockets of
           the court gate, and all the pins of the tabernacle, and all
           the pins of the court round about.

02:039:001 And of the blue, and purple, and scarlet, they made cloths of
           service, to do service in the holy place, and made the holy
           garments for Aaron; as the LORD commanded Moses.

02:039:002 And he made the ephod of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet,
           and fine twined linen.

02:039:003 And they did beat the gold into thin plates, and cut it into
           wires, to work it in the blue, and in the purple, and in the
           scarlet, and in the fine linen, with cunning work.

02:039:004 They made shoulderpieces for it, to couple it together: by the
           two edges was it coupled together.

02:039:005 And the curious girdle of his ephod, that was upon it, was of
           the same, according to the work thereof; of gold, blue, and
           purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen; as the LORD
           commanded Moses.

02:039:006 And they wrought onyx stones inclosed in ouches of gold,
           graven, as signets are graven, with the names of the children
           of Israel.

02:039:007 And he put them on the shoulders of the ephod, that they
           should be stones for a memorial to the children of Israel; as
           the LORD commanded Moses.

02:039:008 And he made the breastplate of cunning work, like the work of
           the ephod; of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine
           twined linen.

02:039:009 It was foursquare; they made the breastplate double: a span
           was the length thereof, and a span the breadth thereof, being
           doubled.

02:039:010 And they set in it four rows of stones: the first row was a
           sardius, a topaz, and a carbuncle: this was the first row.

02:039:011 And the second row, an emerald, a sapphire, and a diamond.

02:039:012 And the third row, a ligure, an agate, and an amethyst.

02:039:013 And the fourth row, a beryl, an onyx, and a jasper: they were
           inclosed in ouches of gold in their inclosings.

02:039:014 And the stones were according to the names of the children of
           Israel, twelve, according to their names, like the engravings
           of a signet, every one with his name, according to the twelve
           tribes.

02:039:015 And they made upon the breastplate chains at the ends, of
           wreathen work of pure gold.

02:039:016 And they made two ouches of gold, and two gold rings; and put
           the two rings in the two ends of the breastplate.

02:039:017 And they put the two wreathen chains of gold in the two rings
           on the ends of the breastplate.

02:039:018 And the two ends of the two wreathen chains they fastened in
           the two ouches, and put them on the shoulderpieces of the
           ephod, before it.

02:039:019 And they made two rings of gold, and put them on the two ends
           of the breastplate, upon the border of it, which was on the
           side of the ephod inward.

02:039:020 And they made two other golden rings, and put them on the two
           sides of the ephod underneath, toward the forepart of it, over
           against the other coupling thereof, above the curious girdle
           of the ephod.

02:039:021 And they did bind the breastplate by his rings unto the rings
           of the ephod with a lace of blue, that it might be above the
           curious girdle of the ephod, and that the breastplate might
           not be loosed from the ephod; as the LORD commanded Moses.

02:039:022 And he made the robe of the ephod of woven work, all of blue.

02:039:023 And there was an hole in the midst of the robe, as the hole of
           an habergeon, with a band round about the hole, that it should
           not rend.

02:039:024 And they made upon the hems of the robe pomegranates of blue,
           and purple, and scarlet, and twined linen.

02:039:025 And they made bells of pure gold, and put the bells between
           the pomegranates upon the hem of the robe, round about between
           the pomegranates;

02:039:026 A bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate, round
           about the hem of the robe to minister in; as the LORD
           commanded Moses.

02:039:027 And they made coats of fine linen of woven work for Aaron, and
           for his sons,

02:039:028 And a mitre of fine linen, and goodly bonnets of fine linen,
           and linen breeches of fine twined linen,

02:039:029 And a girdle of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and
           scarlet, of needlework; as the LORD commanded Moses.

02:039:030 And they made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold, and
           wrote upon it a writing, like to the engravings of a signet,
           HOLINESS TO THE LORD.

02:039:031 And they tied unto it a lace of blue, to fasten it on high
           upon the mitre; as the LORD commanded Moses.

02:039:032 Thus was all the work of the tabernacle of the tent of the
           congregation finished: and the children of Israel did
           according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did they.

02:039:033 And they brought the tabernacle unto Moses, the tent, and all
           his furniture, his taches, his boards, his bars, and his
           pillars, and his sockets,

02:039:034 And the covering of rams' skins dyed red, and the covering of
           badgers' skins, and the vail of the covering,

02:039:035 The ark of the testimony, and the staves thereof, and the
           mercy seat,

02:039:036 The table, and all the vessels thereof, and the shewbread,

02:039:037 The pure candlestick, with the lamps thereof, even with the
           lamps to be set in order, and all the vessels thereof, and the
           oil for light,

02:039:038 And the golden altar, and the anointing oil, and the sweet
           incense, and the hanging for the tabernacle door,

02:039:039 The brasen altar, and his grate of brass, his staves, and all
           his vessels, the laver and his foot,

02:039:040 The hangings of the court, his pillars, and his sockets, and
           the hanging for the court gate, his cords, and his pins, and
           all the vessels of the service of the tabernacle, for the tent
           of the congregation,

02:039:041 The cloths of service to do service in the holy place, and the
           holy garments for Aaron the priest, and his sons' garments, to
           minister in the priest's office.

02:039:042 According to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so the
           children of Israel made all the work.

02:039:043 And Moses did look upon all the work, and, behold, they had
           done it as the LORD had commanded, even so had they done it:
           and Moses blessed them.

02:040:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

02:040:002 On the first day of the first month shalt thou set up the
           tabernacle of the tent of the congregation.

02:040:003 And thou shalt put therein the ark of the testimony, and cover
           the ark with the vail.

02:040:004 And thou shalt bring in the table, and set in order the things
           that are to be set in order upon it; and thou shalt bring in
           the candlestick, and light the lamps thereof.

02:040:005 And thou shalt set the altar of gold for the incense before
           the ark of the testimony, and put the hanging of the door to
           the tabernacle.

02:040:006 And thou shalt set the altar of the burnt offering before the
           door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation.

02:040:007 And thou shalt set the laver between the tent of the
           congregation and the altar, and shalt put water therein.

02:040:008 And thou shalt set up the court round about, and hang up the
           hanging at the court gate.

02:040:009 And thou shalt take the anointing oil, and anoint the
           tabernacle, and all that is therein, and shalt hallow it, and
           all the vessels thereof: and it shall be holy.

02:040:010 And thou shalt anoint the altar of the burnt offering, and all
           his vessels, and sanctify the altar: and it shall be an altar
           most holy.

02:040:011 And thou shalt anoint the laver and his foot, and sanctify it.

02:040:012 And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons unto the door of the
           tabernacle of the congregation, and wash them with water.

02:040:013 And thou shalt put upon Aaron the holy garments, and anoint
           him, and sanctify him; that he may minister unto me in the
           priest's office.

02:040:014 And thou shalt bring his sons, and clothe them with coats:

02:040:015 And thou shalt anoint them, as thou didst anoint their father,
           that they may minister unto me in the priest's office: for
           their anointing shall surely be an everlasting priesthood
           throughout their generations.

02:040:016 Thus did Moses: according to all that the LORD commanded him,
           so did he.

02:040:017 And it came to pass in the first month in the second year, on
           the first day of the month, that the tabernacle was reared up.

02:040:018 And Moses reared up the tabernacle, and fastened his sockets,
           and set up the boards thereof, and put in the bars thereof,
           and reared up his pillars.

02:040:019 And he spread abroad the tent over the tabernacle, and put the
           covering of the tent above upon it; as the LORD commanded
           Moses.

02:040:020 And he took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the
           staves on the ark, and put the mercy seat above upon the ark:

02:040:021 And he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the
           vail of the covering, and covered the ark of the testimony; as
           the LORD commanded Moses.

02:040:022 And he put the table in the tent of the congregation, upon the
           side of the tabernacle northward, without the vail.

02:040:023 And he set the bread in order upon it before the LORD; as the
           LORD had commanded Moses.

02:040:024 And he put the candlestick in the tent of the congregation,
           over against the table, on the side of the tabernacle
           southward.

02:040:025 And he lighted the lamps before the LORD; as the LORD
           commanded Moses.

02:040:026 And he put the golden altar in the tent of the congregation
           before the vail:

02:040:027 And he burnt sweet incense thereon; as the LORD commanded
           Moses.

02:040:028 And he set up the hanging at the door of the tabernacle.

02:040:029 And he put the altar of burnt offering by the door of the
           tabernacle of the tent of the congregation, and offered upon
           it the burnt offering and the meat offering; as the LORD
           commanded Moses.

02:040:030 And he set the laver between the tent of the congregation and
           the altar, and put water there, to wash withal.

02:040:031 And Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their
           feet thereat:

02:040:032 When they went into the tent of the congregation, and when
           they came near unto the altar, they washed; as the LORD
           commanded Moses.

02:040:033 And he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the
           altar, and set up the hanging of the court gate. So Moses
           finished the work.

02:040:034 Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the
           glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.

02:040:035 And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the
           congregation, because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory
           of the LORD filled the tabernacle.

02:040:036 And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the
           children of Israel went onward in all their journeys:

02:040:037 But if the cloud were not taken up, then they journeyed not
           till the day that it was taken up.

02:040:038 For the cloud of the LORD was upon the tabernacle by day, and
           fire was on it by night, in the sight of all the house of
           Israel, throughout all their journeys.

Book 03        Leviticus

03:001:001 And the LORD called unto Moses, and spake unto him out of the
           tabernacle of the congregation, saying,

03:001:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If any
           man of you bring an offering unto the LORD, ye shall bring
           your offering of the cattle, even of the herd, and of the
           flock.

03:001:003 If his offering be a burnt sacrifice of the herd, let him
           offer a male without blemish: he shall offer it of his own
           voluntary will at the door of the tabernacle of the
           congregation before the LORD.

03:001:004 And he shall put his hand upon the head of the burnt offering;
           and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him.

03:001:005 And he shall kill the bullock before the LORD: and the
           priests, Aaron's sons, shall bring the blood, and sprinkle the
           blood round about upon the altar that is by the door of the
           tabernacle of the congregation.

03:001:006 And he shall flay the burnt offering, and cut it into his
           pieces.

03:001:007 And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire upon the
           altar, and lay the wood in order upon the fire:

03:001:008 And the priests, Aaron's sons, shall lay the parts, the head,
           and the fat, in order upon the wood that is on the fire which
           is upon the altar:

03:001:009 But his inwards and his legs shall he wash in water: and the
           priest shall burn all on the altar, to be a burnt sacrifice,
           an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.

03:001:010 And if his offering be of the flocks, namely, of the sheep, or
           of the goats, for a burnt sacrifice; he shall bring it a male
           without blemish.

03:001:011 And he shall kill it on the side of the altar northward before
           the LORD: and the priests, Aaron's sons, shall sprinkle his
           blood round about upon the altar.

03:001:012 And he shall cut it into his pieces, with his head and his
           fat: and the priest shall lay them in order on the wood that
           is on the fire which is upon the altar:

03:001:013 But he shall wash the inwards and the legs with water: and the
           priest shall bring it all, and burn it upon the altar: it is a
           burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour
           unto the LORD.

03:001:014 And if the burnt sacrifice for his offering to the LORD be of
           fowls, then he shall bring his offering of turtledoves, or of
           young pigeons.

03:001:015 And the priest shall bring it unto the altar, and wring off
           his head, and burn it on the altar; and the blood thereof
           shall be wrung out at the side of the altar:

03:001:016 And he shall pluck away his crop with his feathers, and cast
           it beside the altar on the east part, by the place of the
           ashes:

03:001:017 And he shall cleave it with the wings thereof, but shall not
           divide it asunder: and the priest shall burn it upon the
           altar, upon the wood that is upon the fire: it is a burnt
           sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto
           the LORD.

03:002:001 And when any will offer a meat offering unto the LORD, his
           offering shall be of fine flour; and he shall pour oil upon
           it, and put frankincense thereon:

03:002:002 And he shall bring it to Aaron's sons the priests: and he
           shall take thereout his handful of the flour thereof, and of
           the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof; and the
           priest shall burn the memorial of it upon the altar, to be an
           offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD:

03:002:003 And the remnant of the meat offering shall be Aaron's and his
           sons': it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the LORD
           made by fire.

03:002:004 And if thou bring an oblation of a meat offering baken in the
           oven, it shall be unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled with
           oil, or unleavened wafers anointed with oil.

03:002:005 And if thy oblation be a meat offering baken in a pan, it
           shall be of fine flour unleavened, mingled with oil.

03:002:006 Thou shalt part it in pieces, and pour oil thereon: it is a
           meat offering.

03:002:007 And if thy oblation be a meat offering baken in the fryingpan,
           it shall be made of fine flour with oil.

03:002:008 And thou shalt bring the meat offering that is made of these
           things unto the LORD: and when it is presented unto the
           priest, he shall bring it unto the altar.

03:002:009 And the priest shall take from the meat offering a memorial
           thereof, and shall burn it upon the altar: it is an offering
           made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.

03:002:010 And that which is left of the meat offering shall be Aaron's
           and his sons': it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the
           LORD made by fire.

03:002:011 No meat offering, which ye shall bring unto the LORD, shall be
           made with leaven: for ye shall burn no leaven, nor any honey,
           in any offering of the LORD made by fire.

03:002:012 As for the oblation of the firstfruits, ye shall offer them
           unto the LORD: but they shall not be burnt on the altar for a
           sweet savour.

03:002:013 And every oblation of thy meat offering shalt thou season with
           salt; neither shalt thou suffer the salt of the covenant of
           thy God to be lacking from thy meat offering: with all thine
           offerings thou shalt offer salt.

03:002:014 And if thou offer a meat offering of thy firstfruits unto the
           LORD, thou shalt offer for the meat offering of thy
           firstfruits green ears of corn dried by the fire, even corn
           beaten out of full ears.

03:002:015 And thou shalt put oil upon it, and lay frankincense thereon:
           it is a meat offering.

03:002:016 And the priest shall burn the memorial of it, part of the
           beaten corn thereof, and part of the oil thereof, with all the
           frankincense thereof: it is an offering made by fire unto the
           LORD.

03:003:001 And if his oblation be a sacrifice of peace offering, if he
           offer it of the herd; whether it be a male or female, he shall
           offer it without blemish before the LORD.

03:003:002 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, and
           kill it at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and
           Aaron's sons the priests shall sprinkle the blood upon the
           altar round about.

03:003:003 And he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering an
           offering made by fire unto the LORD; the fat that covereth the
           inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards,

03:003:004 And the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by
           the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it
           shall he take away.

03:003:005 And Aaron's sons shall burn it on the altar upon the burnt
           sacrifice, which is upon the wood that is on the fire: it is
           an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.

03:003:006 And if his offering for a sacrifice of peace offering unto the
           LORD be of the flock; male or female, he shall offer it
           without blemish.

03:003:007 If he offer a lamb for his offering, then shall he offer it
           before the LORD.

03:003:008 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, and
           kill it before the tabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron's
           sons shall sprinkle the blood thereof round about upon the
           altar.

03:003:009 And he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering an
           offering made by fire unto the LORD; the fat thereof, and the
           whole rump, it shall he take off hard by the backbone; and the
           fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon
           the inwards,

03:003:010 And the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is
           by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys,
           it shall he take away.

03:003:011 And the priest shall burn it upon the altar: it is the food of
           the offering made by fire unto the LORD.

03:003:012 And if his offering be a goat, then he shall offer it before
           the LORD.

03:003:013 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of it, and kill it
           before the tabernacle of the congregation: and the sons of
           Aaron shall sprinkle the blood thereof upon the altar round
           about.

03:003:014 And he shall offer thereof his offering, even an offering made
           by fire unto the LORD; the fat that covereth the inwards, and
           all the fat that is upon the inwards,

03:003:015 And the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is
           by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys,
           it shall he take away.

03:003:016 And the priest shall burn them upon the altar: it is the food
           of the offering made by fire for a sweet savour: all the fat
           is the LORD's.

03:003:017 It shall be a perpetual statute for your generations
           throughout all your dwellings, that ye eat neither fat nor
           blood.

03:004:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

03:004:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a soul shall sin
           through ignorance against any of the commandments of the LORD
           concerning things which ought not to be done, and shall do
           against any of them:

03:004:003 If the priest that is anointed do sin according to the sin of
           the people; then let him bring for his sin, which he hath
           sinned, a young bullock without blemish unto the LORD for a
           sin offering.

03:004:004 And he shall bring the bullock unto the door of the tabernacle
           of the congregation before the LORD; and shall lay his hand
           upon the bullock's head, and kill the bullock before the LORD.

03:004:005 And the priest that is anointed shall take of the bullock's
           blood, and bring it to the tabernacle of the congregation:

03:004:006 And the priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle
           of the blood seven times before the LORD, before the vail of
           the sanctuary.

03:004:007 And the priest shall put some of the blood upon the horns of
           the altar of sweet incense before the LORD, which is in the
           tabernacle of the congregation; and shall pour all the blood
           of the bullock at the bottom of the altar of the burnt
           offering, which is at the door of the tabernacle of the
           congregation.

03:004:008 And he shall take off from it all the fat of the bullock for
           the sin offering; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all
           the fat that is upon the inwards,

03:004:009 And the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is
           by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys,
           it shall he take away,

03:004:010 As it was taken off from the bullock of the sacrifice of peace
           offerings: and the priest shall burn them upon the altar of
           the burnt offering.

03:004:011 And the skin of the bullock, and all his flesh, with his head,
           and with his legs, and his inwards, and his dung,

03:004:012 Even the whole bullock shall he carry forth without the camp
           unto a clean place, where the ashes are poured out, and burn
           him on the wood with fire: where the ashes are poured out
           shall he be burnt.

03:004:013 And if the whole congregation of Israel sin through ignorance,
           and the thing be hid from the eyes of the assembly, and they
           have done somewhat against any of the commandments of the LORD
           concerning things which should not be done, and are guilty;

03:004:014 When the sin, which they have sinned against it, is known,
           then the congregation shall offer a young bullock for the sin,
           and bring him before the tabernacle of the congregation.

03:004:015 And the elders of the congregation shall lay their hands upon
           the head of the bullock before the LORD: and the bullock shall
           be killed before the LORD.

03:004:016 And the priest that is anointed shall bring of the bullock's
           blood to the tabernacle of the congregation:

03:004:017 And the priest shall dip his finger in some of the blood, and
           sprinkle it seven times before the LORD, even before the vail.

03:004:018 And he shall put some of the blood upon the horns of the altar
           which is before the LORD, that is in the tabernacle of the
           congregation, and shall pour out all the blood at the bottom
           of the altar of the burnt offering, which is at the door of
           the tabernacle of the congregation.

03:004:019 And he shall take all his fat from him, and burn it upon the
           altar.

03:004:020 And he shall do with the bullock as he did with the bullock
           for a sin offering, so shall he do with this: and the priest
           shall make an atonement for them, and it shall be forgiven
           them.

03:004:021 And he shall carry forth the bullock without the camp, and
           burn him as he burned the first bullock: it is a sin offering
           for the congregation.

03:004:022 When a ruler hath sinned, and done somewhat through ignorance
           against any of the commandments of the LORD his God concerning
           things which should not be done, and is guilty;

03:004:023 Or if his sin, wherein he hath sinned, come to his knowledge;
           he shall bring his offering, a kid of the goats, a male
           without blemish:

03:004:024 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the goat, and kill
           it in the place where they kill the burnt offering before the
           LORD: it is a sin offering.

03:004:025 And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering
           with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of
           burnt offering, and shall pour out his blood at the bottom of
           the altar of burnt offering.

03:004:026 And he shall burn all his fat upon the altar, as the fat of
           the sacrifice of peace offerings: and the priest shall make an
           atonement for him as concerning his sin, and it shall be
           forgiven him.

03:004:027 And if any one of the common people sin through ignorance,
           while he doeth somewhat against any of the commandments of the
           LORD concerning things which ought not to be done, and be
           guilty;

03:004:028 Or if his sin, which he hath sinned, come to his knowledge:
           then he shall bring his offering, a kid of the goats, a female
           without blemish, for his sin which he hath sinned.

03:004:029 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering,
           and slay the sin offering in the place of the burnt offering.

03:004:030 And the priest shall take of the blood thereof with his
           finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt
           offering, and shall pour out all the blood thereof at the
           bottom of the altar.

03:004:031 And he shall take away all the fat thereof, as the fat is
           taken away from off the sacrifice of peace offerings; and the
           priest shall burn it upon the altar for a sweet savour unto
           the LORD; and the priest shall make an atonement for him, and
           it shall be forgiven him.

03:004:032 And if he bring a lamb for a sin offering, he shall bring it a
           female without blemish.

03:004:033 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering,
           and slay it for a sin offering in the place where they kill
           the burnt offering.

03:004:034 And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering
           with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of
           burnt offering, and shall pour out all the blood thereof at
           the bottom of the altar:

03:004:035 And he shall take away all the fat thereof, as the fat of the
           lamb is taken away from the sacrifice of the peace offerings;
           and the priest shall burn them upon the altar, according to
           the offerings made by fire unto the LORD: and the priest shall
           make an atonement for his sin that he hath committed, and it
           shall be forgiven him.

03:005:001 And if a soul sin, and hear the voice of swearing, and is a
           witness, whether he hath seen or known of it; if he do not
           utter it, then he shall bear his iniquity.

03:005:002 Or if a soul touch any unclean thing, whether it be a carcase
           of an unclean beast, or a carcase of unclean cattle, or the
           carcase of unclean creeping things, and if it be hidden from
           him; he also shall be unclean, and guilty.

03:005:003 Or if he touch the uncleanness of man, whatsoever uncleanness
           it be that a man shall be defiled withal, and it be hid from
           him; when he knoweth of it, then he shall be guilty.

03:005:004 Or if a soul swear, pronouncing with his lips to do evil, or
           to do good, whatsoever it be that a man shall pronounce with
           an oath, and it be hid from him; when he knoweth of it, then
           he shall be guilty in one of these.

03:005:005 And it shall be, when he shall be guilty in one of these
           things, that he shall confess that he hath sinned in that
           thing:

03:005:006 And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD for his
           sin which he hath sinned, a female from the flock, a lamb or a
           kid of the goats, for a sin offering; and the priest shall
           make an atonement for him concerning his sin.

03:005:007 And if he be not able to bring a lamb, then he shall bring for
           his trespass, which he hath committed, two turtledoves, or two
           young pigeons, unto the LORD; one for a sin offering, and the
           other for a burnt offering.

03:005:008 And he shall bring them unto the priest, who shall offer that
           which is for the sin offering first, and wring off his head
           from his neck, but shall not divide it asunder:

03:005:009 And he shall sprinkle of the blood of the sin offering upon
           the side of the altar; and the rest of the blood shall be
           wrung out at the bottom of the altar: it is a sin offering.

03:005:010 And he shall offer the second for a burnt offering, according
           to the manner: and the priest shall make an atonement for him
           for his sin which he hath sinned, and it shall be forgiven
           him.

03:005:011 But if he be not able to bring two turtledoves, or two young
           pigeons, then he that sinned shall bring for his offering the
           tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a sin offering; he
           shall put no oil upon it, neither shall he put any
           frankincense thereon: for it is a sin offering.

03:005:012 Then shall he bring it to the priest, and the priest shall
           take his handful of it, even a memorial thereof, and burn it
           on the altar, according to the offerings made by fire unto the
           LORD: it is a sin offering.

03:005:013 And the priest shall make an atonement for him as touching his
           sin that he hath sinned in one of these, and it shall be
           forgiven him: and the remnant shall be the priest's, as a meat
           offering.

03:005:014 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

03:005:015 If a soul commit a trespass, and sin through ignorance, in the
           holy things of the LORD; then he shall bring for his trespass
           unto the LORD a ram without blemish out of the flocks, with
           thy estimation by shekels of silver, after the shekel of the
           sanctuary, for a trespass offering.

03:005:016 And he shall make amends for the harm that he hath done in the
           holy thing, and shall add the fifth part thereto, and give it
           unto the priest: and the priest shall make an atonement for
           him with the ram of the trespass offering, and it shall be
           forgiven him.

03:005:017 And if a soul sin, and commit any of these things which are
           forbidden to be done by the commandments of the LORD; though
           he wist it not, yet is he guilty, and shall bear his iniquity.

03:005:018 And he shall bring a ram without blemish out of the flock,
           with thy estimation, for a trespass offering, unto the priest:
           and the priest shall make an atonement for him concerning his
           ignorance wherein he erred and wist it not, and it shall be
           forgiven him.

03:005:019 It is a trespass offering: he hath certainly trespassed
           against the LORD.

03:006:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

03:006:002 If a soul sin, and commit a trespass against the LORD, and lie
           unto his neighbour in that which was delivered him to keep, or
           in fellowship, or in a thing taken away by violence, or hath
           deceived his neighbour;

03:006:003 Or have found that which was lost, and lieth concerning it,
           and sweareth falsely; in any of all these that a man doeth,
           sinning therein:

03:006:004 Then it shall be, because he hath sinned, and is guilty, that
           he shall restore that which he took violently away, or the
           thing which he hath deceitfully gotten, or that which was
           delivered him to keep, or the lost thing which he found,

03:006:005 Or all that about which he hath sworn falsely; he shall even
           restore it in the principal, and shall add the fifth part more
           thereto, and give it unto him to whom it appertaineth, in the
           day of his trespass offering.

03:006:006 And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD, a ram
           without blemish out of the flock, with thy estimation, for a
           trespass offering, unto the priest:

03:006:007 And the priest shall make an atonement for him before the
           LORD: and it shall be forgiven him for any thing of all that
           he hath done in trespassing therein.

03:006:008 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

03:006:009 Command Aaron and his sons, saying, This is the law of the
           burnt offering: It is the burnt offering, because of the
           burning upon the altar all night unto the morning, and the
           fire of the altar shall be burning in it.

03:006:010 And the priest shall put on his linen garment, and his linen
           breeches shall he put upon his flesh, and take up the ashes
           which the fire hath consumed with the burnt offering on the
           altar, and he shall put them beside the altar.

03:006:011 And he shall put off his garments, and put on other garments,
           and carry forth the ashes without the camp unto a clean place.

03:006:012 And the fire upon the altar shall be burning in it; it shall
           not be put out: and the priest shall burn wood on it every
           morning, and lay the burnt offering in order upon it; and he
           shall burn thereon the fat of the peace offerings.

03:006:013 The fire shall ever be burning upon the altar; it shall never
           go out.

03:006:014 And this is the law of the meat offering: the sons of Aaron
           shall offer it before the LORD, before the altar.

03:006:015 And he shall take of it his handful, of the flour of the meat
           offering, and of the oil thereof, and all the frankincense
           which is upon the meat offering, and shall burn it upon the
           altar for a sweet savour, even the memorial of it, unto the
           LORD.

03:006:016 And the remainder thereof shall Aaron and his sons eat: with
           unleavened bread shall it be eaten in the holy place; in the
           court of the tabernacle of the congregation they shall eat it.

03:006:017 It shall not be baken with leaven. I have given it unto them
           for their portion of my offerings made by fire; it is most
           holy, as is the sin offering, and as the trespass offering.

03:006:018 All the males among the children of Aaron shall eat of it. It
           shall be a statute for ever in your generations concerning the
           offerings of the LORD made by fire: every one that toucheth
           them shall be holy.

03:006:019 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

03:006:020 This is the offering of Aaron and of his sons, which they
           shall offer unto the LORD in the day when he is anointed; the
           tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a meat offering
           perpetual, half of it in the morning, and half thereof at
           night.

03:006:021 In a pan it shall be made with oil; and when it is baken, thou
           shalt bring it in: and the baken pieces of the meat offering
           shalt thou offer for a sweet savour unto the LORD.

03:006:022 And the priest of his sons that is anointed in his stead shall
           offer it: it is a statute for ever unto the LORD; it shall be
           wholly burnt.

03:006:023 For every meat offering for the priest shall be wholly burnt:
           it shall not be eaten.

03:006:024 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

03:006:025 Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, saying, This is the law of
           the sin offering: In the place where the burnt offering is
           killed shall the sin offering be killed before the LORD: it is
           most holy.

03:006:026 The priest that offereth it for sin shall eat it: in the holy
           place shall it be eaten, in the court of the tabernacle of the
           congregation.

03:006:027 Whatsoever shall touch the flesh thereof shall be holy: and
           when there is sprinkled of the blood thereof upon any garment,
           thou shalt wash that whereon it was sprinkled in the holy
           place.

03:006:028 But the earthen vessel wherein it is sodden shall be broken:
           and if it be sodden in a brasen pot, it shall be both scoured,
           and rinsed in water.

03:006:029 All the males among the priests shall eat thereof: it is most
           holy.

03:006:030 And no sin offering, whereof any of the blood is brought into
           the tabernacle of the congregation to reconcile withal in the
           holy place, shall be eaten: it shall be burnt in the fire.

03:007:001 Likewise this is the law of the trespass offering: it is most
           holy.

03:007:002 In the place where they kill the burnt offering shall they
           kill the trespass offering: and the blood thereof shall he
           sprinkle round about upon the altar.

03:007:003 And he shall offer of it all the fat thereof; the rump, and
           the fat that covereth the inwards,

03:007:004 And the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by
           the flanks, and the caul that is above the liver, with the
           kidneys, it shall he take away:

03:007:005 And the priest shall burn them upon the altar for an offering
           made by fire unto the LORD: it is a trespass offering.

03:007:006 Every male among the priests shall eat thereof: it shall be
           eaten in the holy place: it is most holy.

03:007:007 As the sin offering is, so is the trespass offering: there is
           one law for them: the priest that maketh atonement therewith
           shall have it.

03:007:008 And the priest that offereth any man's burnt offering, even
           the priest shall have to himself the skin of the burnt
           offering which he hath offered.

03:007:009 And all the meat offering that is baken in the oven, and all
           that is dressed in the fryingpan, and in the pan, shall be the
           priest's that offereth it.

03:007:010 And every meat offering, mingled with oil, and dry, shall all
           the sons of Aaron have, one as much as another.

03:007:011 And this is the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which
           he shall offer unto the LORD.

03:007:012 If he offer it for a thanksgiving, then he shall offer with
           the sacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened cakes mingled with
           oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and cakes
           mingled with oil, of fine flour, fried.

03:007:013 Besides the cakes, he shall offer for his offering leavened
           bread with the sacrifice of thanksgiving of his peace
           offerings.

03:007:014 And of it he shall offer one out of the whole oblation for an
           heave offering unto the LORD, and it shall be the priest's
           that sprinkleth the blood of the peace offerings.

03:007:015 And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings for
           thanksgiving shall be eaten the same day that it is offered;
           he shall not leave any of it until the morning.

03:007:016 But if the sacrifice of his offering be a vow, or a voluntary
           offering, it shall be eaten the same day that he offereth his
           sacrifice: and on the morrow also the remainder of it shall be
           eaten:

03:007:017 But the remainder of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third
           day shall be burnt with fire.

03:007:018 And if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace
           offerings be eaten at all on the third day, it shall not be
           accepted, neither shall it be imputed unto him that offereth
           it: it shall be an abomination, and the soul that eateth of it
           shall bear his iniquity.

03:007:019 And the flesh that toucheth any unclean thing shall not be
           eaten; it shall be burnt with fire: and as for the flesh, all
           that be clean shall eat thereof.

03:007:020 But the soul that eateth of the flesh of the sacrifice of
           peace offerings, that pertain unto the LORD, having his
           uncleanness upon him, even that soul shall be cut off from his
           people.

03:007:021 Moreover the soul that shall touch any unclean thing, as the
           uncleanness of man, or any unclean beast, or any abominable
           unclean thing, and eat of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace
           offerings, which pertain unto the LORD, even that soul shall
           be cut off from his people.

03:007:022 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

03:007:023 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Ye shall eat no
           manner of fat, of ox, or of sheep, or of goat.

03:007:024 And the fat of the beast that dieth of itself, and the fat of
           that which is torn with beasts, may be used in any other use:
           but ye shall in no wise eat of it.

03:007:025 For whosoever eateth the fat of the beast, of which men offer
           an offering made by fire unto the LORD, even the soul that
           eateth it shall be cut off from his people.

03:007:026 Moreover ye shall eat no manner of blood, whether it be of
           fowl or of beast, in any of your dwellings.

03:007:027 Whatsoever soul it be that eateth any manner of blood, even
           that soul shall be cut off from his people.

03:007:028 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

03:007:029 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, He that offereth
           the sacrifice of his peace offerings unto the LORD shall bring
           his oblation unto the LORD of the sacrifice of his peace
           offerings.

03:007:030 His own hands shall bring the offerings of the LORD made by
           fire, the fat with the breast, it shall he bring, that the
           breast may be waved for a wave offering before the LORD.

03:007:031 And the priest shall burn the fat upon the altar: but the
           breast shall be Aaron's and his sons'.

03:007:032 And the right shoulder shall ye give unto the priest for an
           heave offering of the sacrifices of your peace offerings.

03:007:033 He among the sons of Aaron, that offereth the blood of the
           peace offerings, and the fat, shall have the right shoulder
           for his part.

03:007:034 For the wave breast and the heave shoulder have I taken of the
           children of Israel from off the sacrifices of their peace
           offerings, and have given them unto Aaron the priest and unto
           his sons by a statute for ever from among the children of
           Israel.

03:007:035 This is the portion of the anointing of Aaron, and of the
           anointing of his sons, out of the offerings of the LORD made
           by fire, in the day when he presented them to minister unto
           the LORD in the priest's office;

03:007:036 Which the LORD commanded to be given them of the children of
           Israel, in the day that he anointed them, by a statute for
           ever throughout their generations.

03:007:037 This is the law of the burnt offering, of the meat offering,
           and of the sin offering, and of the trespass offering, and of
           the consecrations, and of the sacrifice of the peace
           offerings;

03:007:038 Which the LORD commanded Moses in mount Sinai, in the day that
           he commanded the children of Israel to offer their oblations
           unto the LORD, in the wilderness of Sinai.

03:008:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

03:008:002 Take Aaron and his sons with him, and the garments, and the
           anointing oil, and a bullock for the sin offering, and two
           rams, and a basket of unleavened bread;

03:008:003 And gather thou all the congregation together unto the door of
           the tabernacle of the congregation.

03:008:004 And Moses did as the LORD commanded him; and the assembly was
           gathered together unto the door of the tabernacle of the
           congregation.

03:008:005 And Moses said unto the congregation, This is the thing which
           the LORD commanded to be done.

03:008:006 And Moses brought Aaron and his sons, and washed them with
           water.

03:008:007 And he put upon him the coat, and girded him with the girdle,
           and clothed him with the robe, and put the ephod upon him, and
           he girded him with the curious girdle of the ephod, and bound
           it unto him therewith.

03:008:008 And he put the breastplate upon him: also he put in the
           breastplate the Urim and the Thummim.

03:008:009 And he put the mitre upon his head; also upon the mitre, even
           upon his forefront, did he put the golden plate, the holy
           crown; as the LORD commanded Moses.

03:008:010 And Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle
           and all that was therein, and sanctified them.

03:008:011 And he sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven times, and
           anointed the altar and all his vessels, both the laver and his
           foot, to sanctify them.

03:008:012 And he poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron's head, and
           anointed him, to sanctify him.

03:008:013 And Moses brought Aaron's sons, and put coats upon them, and
           girded them with girdles, and put bonnets upon them; as the
           LORD commanded Moses.

03:008:014 And he brought the bullock for the sin offering: and Aaron and
           his sons laid their hands upon the head of the bullock for the
           sin offering.

03:008:015 And he slew it; and Moses took the blood, and put it upon the
           horns of the altar round about with his finger, and purified
           the altar, and poured the blood at the bottom of the altar,
           and sanctified it, to make reconciliation upon it.

03:008:016 And he took all the fat that was upon the inwards, and the
           caul above the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and
           Moses burned it upon the altar.

03:008:017 But the bullock, and his hide, his flesh, and his dung, he
           burnt with fire without the camp; as the LORD commanded Moses.

03:008:018 And he brought the ram for the burnt offering: and Aaron and
           his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.

03:008:019 And he killed it; and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar
           round about.

03:008:020 And he cut the ram into pieces; and Moses burnt the head, and
           the pieces, and the fat.

03:008:021 And he washed the inwards and the legs in water; and Moses
           burnt the whole ram upon the altar: it was a burnt sacrifice
           for a sweet savour, and an offering made by fire unto the
           LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses.

03:008:022 And he brought the other ram, the ram of consecration: and
           Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.

03:008:023 And he slew it; and Moses took of the blood of it, and put it
           upon the tip of Aaron's right ear, and upon the thumb of his
           right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot.

03:008:024 And he brought Aaron's sons, and Moses put of the blood upon
           the tip of their right ear, and upon the thumbs of their right
           hands, and upon the great toes of their right feet: and Moses
           sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about.

03:008:025 And he took the fat, and the rump, and all the fat that was
           upon the inwards, and the caul above the liver, and the two
           kidneys, and their fat, and the right shoulder:

03:008:026 And out of the basket of unleavened bread, that was before the
           LORD, he took one unleavened cake, and a cake of oiled bread,
           and one wafer, and put them on the fat, and upon the right
           shoulder:

03:008:027 And he put all upon Aaron's hands, and upon his sons' hands,
           and waved them for a wave offering before the LORD.

03:008:028 And Moses took them from off their hands, and burnt them on
           the altar upon the burnt offering: they were consecrations for
           a sweet savour: it is an offering made by fire unto the LORD.

03:008:029 And Moses took the breast, and waved it for a wave offering
           before the LORD: for of the ram of consecration it was Moses'
           part; as the LORD commanded Moses.

03:008:030 And Moses took of the anointing oil, and of the blood which
           was upon the altar, and sprinkled it upon Aaron, and upon his
           garments, and upon his sons, and upon his sons' garments with
           him; and sanctified Aaron, and his garments, and his sons, and
           his sons' garments with him.

03:008:031 And Moses said unto Aaron and to his sons, Boil the flesh at
           the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and there eat
           it with the bread that is in the basket of consecrations, as I
           commanded, saying, Aaron and his sons shall eat it.

03:008:032 And that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread shall
           ye burn with fire.

03:008:033 And ye shall not go out of the door of the tabernacle of the
           congregation in seven days, until the days of your
           consecration be at an end: for seven days shall he consecrate
           you.

03:008:034 As he hath done this day, so the LORD hath commanded to do, to
           make an atonement for you.

03:008:035 Therefore shall ye abide at the door of the tabernacle of the
           congregation day and night seven days, and keep the charge of
           the LORD, that ye die not: for so I am commanded.

03:008:036 So Aaron and his sons did all things which the LORD commanded
           by the hand of Moses.

03:009:001 And it came to pass on the eighth day, that Moses called Aaron
           and his sons, and the elders of Israel;

03:009:002 And he said unto Aaron, Take thee a young calf for a sin
           offering, and a ram for a burnt offering, without blemish, and
           offer them before the LORD.

03:009:003 And unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak, saying, Take
           ye a kid of the goats for a sin offering; and a calf and a
           lamb, both of the first year, without blemish, for a burnt
           offering;

03:009:004 Also a bullock and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice
           before the LORD; and a meat offering mingled with oil: for to
           day the LORD will appear unto you.

03:009:005 And they brought that which Moses commanded before the
           tabernacle of the congregation: and all the congregation drew
           near and stood before the LORD.

03:009:006 And Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD commanded
           that ye should do: and the glory of the LORD shall appear unto
           you.

03:009:007 And Moses said unto Aaron, Go unto the altar, and offer thy
           sin offering, and thy burnt offering, and make an atonement
           for thyself, and for the people: and offer the offering of the
           people, and make an atonement for them; as the LORD commanded.

03:009:008 Aaron therefore went unto the altar, and slew the calf of the
           sin offering, which was for himself.

03:009:009 And the sons of Aaron brought the blood unto him: and he
           dipped his finger in the blood, and put it upon the horns of
           the altar, and poured out the blood at the bottom of the
           altar:

03:009:010 But the fat, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver of
           the sin offering, he burnt upon the altar; as the LORD
           commanded Moses.

03:009:011 And the flesh and the hide he burnt with fire without the
           camp.

03:009:012 And he slew the burnt offering; and Aaron's sons presented
           unto him the blood, which he sprinkled round about upon the
           altar.

03:009:013 And they presented the burnt offering unto him, with the
           pieces thereof, and the head: and he burnt them upon the
           altar.

03:009:014 And he did wash the inwards and the legs, and burnt them upon
           the burnt offering on the altar.

03:009:015 And he brought the people's offering, and took the goat, which
           was the sin offering for the people, and slew it, and offered
           it for sin, as the first.

03:009:016 And he brought the burnt offering, and offered it according to
           the manner.

03:009:017 And he brought the meat offering, and took an handful thereof,
           and burnt it upon the altar, beside the burnt sacrifice of the
           morning.

03:009:018 He slew also the bullock and the ram for a sacrifice of peace
           offerings, which was for the people: and Aaron's sons
           presented unto him the blood, which he sprinkled upon the
           altar round about,

03:009:019 And the fat of the bullock and of the ram, the rump, and that
           which covereth the inwards, and the kidneys, and the caul
           above the liver:

03:009:020 And they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burnt the fat
           upon the altar:

03:009:021 And the breasts and the right shoulder Aaron waved for a wave
           offering before the LORD; as Moses commanded.

03:009:022 And Aaron lifted up his hand toward the people, and blessed
           them, and came down from offering of the sin offering, and the
           burnt offering, and peace offerings.

03:009:023 And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the
           congregation, and came out, and blessed the people: and the
           glory of the LORD appeared unto all the people.

03:009:024 And there came a fire out from before the LORD, and consumed
           upon the altar the burnt offering and the fat: which when all
           the people saw, they shouted, and fell on their faces.

03:010:001 And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took either of them
           his censer, and put fire therein, and put incense thereon, and
           offered strange fire before the LORD, which he commanded them
           not.

03:010:002 And there went out fire from the LORD, and devoured them, and
           they died before the LORD.

03:010:003 Then Moses said unto Aaron, This is it that the LORD spake,
           saying, I will be sanctified in them that come nigh me, and
           before all the people I will be glorified. And Aaron held his
           peace.

03:010:004 And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the
           uncle of Aaron, and said unto them, Come near, carry your
           brethren from before the sanctuary out of the camp.

03:010:005 So they went near, and carried them in their coats out of the
           camp; as Moses had said.

03:010:006 And Moses said unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar,
           his sons, Uncover not your heads, neither rend your clothes;
           lest ye die, and lest wrath come upon all the people: but let
           your brethren, the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning
           which the LORD hath kindled.

03:010:007 And ye shall not go out from the door of the tabernacle of the
           congregation, lest ye die: for the anointing oil of the LORD
           is upon you. And they did according to the word of Moses.

03:010:008 And the LORD spake unto Aaron, saying,

03:010:009 Do not drink wine nor strong drink, thou, nor thy sons with
           thee, when ye go into the tabernacle of the congregation, lest
           ye die: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your
           generations:

03:010:010 And that ye may put difference between holy and unholy, and
           between unclean and clean;

03:010:011 And that ye may teach the children of Israel all the statutes
           which the LORD hath spoken unto them by the hand of Moses.

03:010:012 And Moses spake unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar,
           his sons that were left, Take the meat offering that remaineth
           of the offerings of the LORD made by fire, and eat it without
           leaven beside the altar: for it is most holy:

03:010:013 And ye shall eat it in the holy place, because it is thy due,
           and thy sons' due, of the sacrifices of the LORD made by fire:
           for so I am commanded.

03:010:014 And the wave breast and heave shoulder shall ye eat in a clean
           place; thou, and thy sons, and thy daughters with thee: for
           they be thy due, and thy sons' due, which are given out of the
           sacrifices of peace offerings of the children of Israel.

03:010:015 The heave shoulder and the wave breast shall they bring with
           the offerings made by fire of the fat, to wave it for a wave
           offering before the LORD; and it shall be thine, and thy sons'
           with thee, by a statute for ever; as the LORD hath commanded.

03:010:016 And Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin offering, and,
           behold, it was burnt: and he was angry with Eleazar and
           Ithamar, the sons of Aaron which were left alive, saying,

03:010:017 Wherefore have ye not eaten the sin offering in the holy
           place, seeing it is most holy, and God hath given it you to
           bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for
           them before the LORD?

03:010:018 Behold, the blood of it was not brought in within the holy
           place: ye should indeed have eaten it in the holy place, as I
           commanded.

03:010:019 And Aaron said unto Moses, Behold, this day have they offered
           their sin offering and their burnt offering before the LORD;
           and such things have befallen me: and if I had eaten the sin
           offering to day, should it have been accepted in the sight of
           the LORD?

03:010:020 And when Moses heard that, he was content.

03:011:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying unto them,

03:011:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, These are the
           beasts which ye shall eat among all the beasts that are on the
           earth.

03:011:003 Whatsoever parteth the hoof, and is clovenfooted, and cheweth
           the cud, among the beasts, that shall ye eat.

03:011:004 Nevertheless these shall ye not eat of them that chew the cud,
           or of them that divide the hoof: as the camel, because he
           cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto
           you.

03:011:005 And the coney, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not
           the hoof; he is unclean unto you.

03:011:006 And the hare, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the
           hoof; he is unclean unto you.

03:011:007 And the swine, though he divide the hoof, and be clovenfooted,
           yet he cheweth not the cud; he is unclean to you.

03:011:008 Of their flesh shall ye not eat, and their carcase shall ye
           not touch; they are unclean to you.

03:011:009 These shall ye eat of all that are in the waters: whatsoever
           hath fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the
           rivers, them shall ye eat.

03:011:010 And all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the
           rivers, of all that move in the waters, and of any living
           thing which is in the waters, they shall be an abomination
           unto you:

03:011:011 They shall be even an abomination unto you; ye shall not eat
           of their flesh, but ye shall have their carcases in
           abomination.

03:011:012 Whatsoever hath no fins nor scales in the waters, that shall
           be an abomination unto you.

03:011:013 And these are they which ye shall have in abomination among
           the fowls; they shall not be eaten, they are an abomination:
           the eagle, and the ossifrage, and the ospray,

03:011:014 And the vulture, and the kite after his kind;

03:011:015 Every raven after his kind;

03:011:016 And the owl, and the night hawk, and the cuckow, and the hawk
           after his kind,

03:011:017 And the little owl, and the cormorant, and the great owl,

03:011:018 And the swan, and the pelican, and the gier eagle,

03:011:019 And the stork, the heron after her kind, and the lapwing, and
           the bat.

03:011:020 All fowls that creep, going upon all four, shall be an
           abomination unto you.

03:011:021 Yet these may ye eat of every flying creeping thing that goeth
           upon all four, which have legs above their feet, to leap
           withal upon the earth;

03:011:022 Even these of them ye may eat; the locust after his kind, and
           the bald locust after his kind, and the beetle after his kind,
           and the grasshopper after his kind.

03:011:023 But all other flying creeping things, which have four feet,
           shall be an abomination unto you.

03:011:024 And for these ye shall be unclean: whosoever toucheth the
           carcase of them shall be unclean until the even.

03:011:025 And whosoever beareth ought of the carcase of them shall wash
           his clothes, and be unclean until the even.

03:011:026 The carcases of every beast which divideth the hoof, and is
           not clovenfooted, nor cheweth the cud, are unclean unto you:
           every one that toucheth them shall be unclean.

03:011:027 And whatsoever goeth upon his paws, among all manner of beasts
           that go on all four, those are unclean unto you: whoso
           toucheth their carcase shall be unclean until the even.

03:011:028 And he that beareth the carcase of them shall wash his
           clothes, and be unclean until the even: they are unclean unto
           you.

03:011:029 These also shall be unclean unto you among the creeping things
           that creep upon the earth; the weasel, and the mouse, and the
           tortoise after his kind,

03:011:030 And the ferret, and the chameleon, and the lizard, and the
           snail, and the mole.

03:011:031 These are unclean to you among all that creep: whosoever doth
           touch them, when they be dead, shall be unclean until the
           even.

03:011:032 And upon whatsoever any of them, when they are dead, doth
           fall, it shall be unclean; whether it be any vessel of wood,
           or raiment, or skin, or sack, whatsoever vessel it be, wherein
           any work is done, it must be put into water, and it shall be
           unclean until the even; so it shall be cleansed.

03:011:033 And every earthen vessel, whereinto any of them falleth,
           whatsoever is in it shall be unclean; and ye shall break it.

03:011:034 Of all meat which may be eaten, that on which such water
           cometh shall be unclean: and all drink that may be drunk in
           every such vessel shall be unclean.

03:011:035 And every thing whereupon any part of their carcase falleth
           shall be unclean; whether it be oven, or ranges for pots, they
           shall be broken down: for they are unclean and shall be
           unclean unto you.

03:011:036 Nevertheless a fountain or pit, wherein there is plenty of
           water, shall be clean: but that which toucheth their carcase
           shall be unclean.

03:011:037 And if any part of their carcase fall upon any sowing seed
           which is to be sown, it shall be clean.

03:011:038 But if any water be put upon the seed, and any part of their
           carcase fall thereon, it shall be unclean unto you.

03:011:039 And if any beast, of which ye may eat, die; he that toucheth
           the carcase thereof shall be unclean until the even.

03:011:040 And he that eateth of the carcase of it shall wash his
           clothes, and be unclean until the even: he also that beareth
           the carcase of it shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until
           the even.

03:011:041 And every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth shall be
           an abomination; it shall not be eaten.

03:011:042 Whatsoever goeth upon the belly, and whatsoever goeth upon all
           four, or whatsoever hath more feet among all creeping things
           that creep upon the earth, them ye shall not eat; for they are
           an abomination.

03:011:043 Ye shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping
           thing that creepeth, neither shall ye make yourselves unclean
           with them, that ye should be defiled thereby.

03:011:044 For I am the LORD your God: ye shall therefore sanctify
           yourselves, and ye shall be holy; for I am holy: neither shall
           ye defile yourselves with any manner of creeping thing that
           creepeth upon the earth.

03:011:045 For I am the LORD that bringeth you up out of the land of
           Egypt, to be your God: ye shall therefore be holy, for I am
           holy.

03:011:046 This is the law of the beasts, and of the fowl, and of every
           living creature that moveth in the waters, and of every
           creature that creepeth upon the earth:

03:011:047 To make a difference between the unclean and the clean, and
           between the beast that may be eaten and the beast that may not
           be eaten.

03:012:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

03:012:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a woman have
           conceived seed, and born a man child: then she shall be
           unclean seven days; according to the days of the separation
           for her infirmity shall she be unclean.

03:012:003 And in the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be
           circumcised.

03:012:004 And she shall then continue in the blood of her purifying
           three and thirty days; she shall touch no hallowed thing, nor
           come into the sanctuary, until the days of her purifying be
           fulfilled.

03:012:005 But if she bear a maid child, then she shall be unclean two
           weeks, as in her separation: and she shall continue in the
           blood of her purifying threescore and six days.

03:012:006 And when the days of her purifying are fulfilled, for a son,
           or for a daughter, she shall bring a lamb of the first year
           for a burnt offering, and a young pigeon, or a turtledove, for
           a sin offering, unto the door of the tabernacle of the
           congregation, unto the priest:

03:012:007 Who shall offer it before the LORD, and make an atonement for
           her; and she shall be cleansed from the issue of her blood.
           This is the law for her that hath born a male or a female.

03:012:008 And if she be not able to bring a lamb, then she shall bring
           two turtles, or two young pigeons; the one for the burnt
           offering, and the other for a sin offering: and the priest
           shall make an atonement for her, and she shall be clean.

03:013:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron, saying,

03:013:002 When a man shall have in the skin of his flesh a rising, a
           scab, or bright spot, and it be in the skin of his flesh like
           the plague of leprosy; then he shall be brought unto Aaron the
           priest, or unto one of his sons the priests:

03:013:003 And the priest shall look on the plague in the skin of the
           flesh: and when the hair in the plague is turned white, and
           the plague in sight be deeper than the skin of his flesh, it
           is a plague of leprosy: and the priest shall look on him, and
           pronounce him unclean.

03:013:004 If the bright spot be white in the skin of his flesh, and in
           sight be not deeper than the skin, and the hair thereof be not
           turned white; then the priest shall shut up him that hath the
           plague seven days:

03:013:005 And the priest shall look on him the seventh day: and, behold,
           if the plague in his sight be at a stay, and the plague spread
           not in the skin; then the priest shall shut him up seven days
           more:

03:013:006 And the priest shall look on him again the seventh day: and,
           behold, if the plague be somewhat dark, and the plague spread
           not in the skin, the priest shall pronounce him clean: it is
           but a scab: and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean.

03:013:007 But if the scab spread much abroad in the skin, after that he
           hath been seen of the priest for his cleansing, he shall be
           seen of the priest again.

03:013:008 And if the priest see that, behold, the scab spreadeth in the
           skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a
           leprosy.

03:013:009 When the plague of leprosy is in a man, then he shall be
           brought unto the priest;

03:013:010 And the priest shall see him: and, behold, if the rising be
           white in the skin, and it have turned the hair white, and
           there be quick raw flesh in the rising;

03:013:011 It is an old leprosy in the skin of his flesh, and the priest
           shall pronounce him unclean, and shall not shut him up: for he
           is unclean.

03:013:012 And if a leprosy break out abroad in the skin, and the leprosy
           cover all the skin of him that hath the plague from his head
           even to his foot, wheresoever the priest looketh;

03:013:013 Then the priest shall consider: and, behold, if the leprosy
           have covered all his flesh, he shall pronounce him clean that
           hath the plague: it is all turned white: he is clean.

03:013:014 But when raw flesh appeareth in him, he shall be unclean.

03:013:015 And the priest shall see the raw flesh, and pronounce him to
           be unclean: for the raw flesh is unclean: it is a leprosy.

03:013:016 Or if the raw flesh turn again, and be changed unto white, he
           shall come unto the priest;

03:013:017 And the priest shall see him: and, behold, if the plague be
           turned into white; then the priest shall pronounce him clean
           that hath the plague: he is clean.

03:013:018 The flesh also, in which, even in the skin thereof, was a
           boil, and is healed,

03:013:019 And in the place of the boil there be a white rising, or a
           bright spot, white, and somewhat reddish, and it be shewed to
           the priest;

03:013:020 And if, when the priest seeth it, behold, it be in sight lower
           than the skin, and the hair thereof be turned white; the
           priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a plague of leprosy
           broken out of the boil.

03:013:021 But if the priest look on it, and, behold, there be no white
           hairs therein, and if it be not lower than the skin, but be
           somewhat dark; then the priest shall shut him up seven days:

03:013:022 And if it spread much abroad in the skin, then the priest
           shall pronounce him unclean: it is a plague.

03:013:023 But if the bright spot stay in his place, and spread not, it
           is a burning boil; and the priest shall pronounce him clean.

03:013:024 Or if there be any flesh, in the skin whereof there is a hot
           burning, and the quick flesh that burneth have a white bright
           spot, somewhat reddish, or white;

03:013:025 Then the priest shall look upon it: and, behold, if the hair
           in the bright spot be turned white, and it be in sight deeper
           than the skin; it is a leprosy broken out of the burning:
           wherefore the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is the
           plague of leprosy.

03:013:026 But if the priest look on it, and, behold, there be no white
           hair in the bright spot, and it be no lower than the other
           skin, but be somewhat dark; then the priest shall shut him up
           seven days:

03:013:027 And the priest shall look upon him the seventh day: and if it
           be spread much abroad in the skin, then the priest shall
           pronounce him unclean: it is the plague of leprosy.

03:013:028 And if the bright spot stay in his place, and spread not in
           the skin, but it be somewhat dark; it is a rising of the
           burning, and the priest shall pronounce him clean: for it is
           an inflammation of the burning.

03:013:029 If a man or woman have a plague upon the head or the beard;

03:013:030 Then the priest shall see the plague: and, behold, if it be in
           sight deeper than the skin; and there be in it a yellow thin
           hair; then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a dry
           scall, even a leprosy upon the head or beard.

03:013:031 And if the priest look on the plague of the scall, and,
           behold, it be not in sight deeper than the skin, and that
           there is no black hair in it; then the priest shall shut up
           him that hath the plague of the scall seven days:

03:013:032 And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the plague:
           and, behold, if the scall spread not, and there be in it no
           yellow hair, and the scall be not in sight deeper than the
           skin;

03:013:033 He shall be shaven, but the scall shall he not shave; and the
           priest shall shut up him that hath the scall seven days more:

03:013:034 And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the scall:
           and, behold, if the scall be not spread in the skin, nor be in
           sight deeper than the skin; then the priest shall pronounce
           him clean: and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean.

03:013:035 But if the scall spread much in the skin after his cleansing;

03:013:036 Then the priest shall look on him: and, behold, if the scall
           be spread in the skin, the priest shall not seek for yellow
           hair; he is unclean.

03:013:037 But if the scall be in his sight at a stay, and that there is
           black hair grown up therein; the scall is healed, he is clean:
           and the priest shall pronounce him clean.

03:013:038 If a man also or a woman have in the skin of their flesh
           bright spots, even white bright spots;

03:013:039 Then the priest shall look: and, behold, if the bright spots
           in the skin of their flesh be darkish white; it is a freckled
           spot that groweth in the skin; he is clean.

03:013:040 And the man whose hair is fallen off his head, he is bald; yet
           is he clean.

03:013:041 And he that hath his hair fallen off from the part of his head
           toward his face, he is forehead bald: yet is he clean.

03:013:042 And if there be in the bald head, or bald forehead, a white
           reddish sore; it is a leprosy sprung up in his bald head, or
           his bald forehead.

03:013:043 Then the priest shall look upon it: and, behold, if the rising
           of the sore be white reddish in his bald head, or in his bald
           forehead, as the leprosy appeareth in the skin of the flesh;

03:013:044 He is a leprous man, he is unclean: the priest shall pronounce
           him utterly unclean; his plague is in his head.

03:013:045 And the leper in whom the plague is, his clothes shall be
           rent, and his head bare, and he shall put a covering upon his
           upper lip, and shall cry, Unclean, unclean.

03:013:046 All the days wherein the plague shall be in him he shall be
           defiled; he is unclean: he shall dwell alone; without the camp
           shall his habitation be.

03:013:047 The garment also that the plague of leprosy is in, whether it
           be a woollen garment, or a linen garment;

03:013:048 Whether it be in the warp, or woof; of linen, or of woollen;
           whether in a skin, or in any thing made of skin;

03:013:049 And if the plague be greenish or reddish in the garment, or in
           the skin, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing
           of skin; it is a plague of leprosy, and shall be shewed unto
           the priest:

03:013:050 And the priest shall look upon the plague, and shut up it that
           hath the plague seven days:

03:013:051 And he shall look on the plague on the seventh day: if the
           plague be spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the
           woof, or in a skin, or in any work that is made of skin; the
           plague is a fretting leprosy; it is unclean.

03:013:052 He shall therefore burn that garment, whether warp or woof, in
           woollen or in linen, or any thing of skin, wherein the plague
           is: for it is a fretting leprosy; it shall be burnt in the
           fire.

03:013:053 And if the priest shall look, and, behold, the plague be not
           spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or
           in any thing of skin;

03:013:054 Then the priest shall command that they wash the thing wherein
           the plague is, and he shall shut it up seven days more:

03:013:055 And the priest shall look on the plague, after that it is
           washed: and, behold, if the plague have not changed his
           colour, and the plague be not spread; it is unclean; thou
           shalt burn it in the fire; it is fret inward, whether it be
           bare within or without.

03:013:056 And if the priest look, and, behold, the plague be somewhat
           dark after the washing of it; then he shall rend it out of the
           garment, or out of the skin, or out of the warp, or out of the
           woof:

03:013:057 And if it appear still in the garment, either in the warp, or
           in the woof, or in any thing of skin; it is a spreading
           plague: thou shalt burn that wherein the plague is with fire.

03:013:058 And the garment, either warp, or woof, or whatsoever thing of
           skin it be, which thou shalt wash, if the plague be departed
           from them, then it shall be washed the second time, and shall
           be clean.

03:013:059 This is the law of the plague of leprosy in a garment of
           woollen or linen, either in the warp, or woof, or any thing of
           skins, to pronounce it clean, or to pronounce it unclean.

03:014:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

03:014:002 This shall be the law of the leper in the day of his
           cleansing: He shall be brought unto the priest:

03:014:003 And the priest shall go forth out of the camp; and the priest
           shall look, and, behold, if the plague of leprosy be healed in
           the leper;

03:014:004 Then shall the priest command to take for him that is to be
           cleansed two birds alive and clean, and cedar wood, and
           scarlet, and hyssop:

03:014:005 And the priest shall command that one of the birds be killed
           in an earthen vessel over running water:

03:014:006 As for the living bird, he shall take it, and the cedar wood,
           and the scarlet, and the hyssop, and shall dip them and the
           living bird in the blood of the bird that was killed over the
           running water:

03:014:007 And he shall sprinkle upon him that is to be cleansed from the
           leprosy seven times, and shall pronounce him clean, and shall
           let the living bird loose into the open field.

03:014:008 And he that is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes, and
           shave off all his hair, and wash himself in water, that he may
           be clean: and after that he shall come into the camp, and
           shall tarry abroad out of his tent seven days.

03:014:009 But it shall be on the seventh day, that he shall shave all
           his hair off his head and his beard and his eyebrows, even all
           his hair he shall shave off: and he shall wash his clothes,
           also he shall wash his flesh in water, and he shall be clean.

03:014:010 And on the eighth day he shall take two he lambs without
           blemish, and one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish,
           and three tenth deals of fine flour for a meat offering,
           mingled with oil, and one log of oil.

03:014:011 And the priest that maketh him clean shall present the man
           that is to be made clean, and those things, before the LORD,
           at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation:

03:014:012 And the priest shall take one he lamb, and offer him for a
           trespass offering, and the log of oil, and wave them for a
           wave offering before the LORD:

03:014:013 And he shall slay the lamb in the place where he shall kill
           the sin offering and the burnt offering, in the holy place:
           for as the sin offering is the priest's, so is the trespass
           offering: it is most holy:

03:014:014 And the priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass
           offering, and the priest shall put it upon the tip of the
           right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of
           his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot:

03:014:015 And the priest shall take some of the log of oil, and pour it
           into the palm of his own left hand:

03:014:016 And the priest shall dip his right finger in the oil that is
           in his left hand, and shall sprinkle of the oil with his
           finger seven times before the LORD:

03:014:017 And of the rest of the oil that is in his hand shall the
           priest put upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be
           cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the
           great toe of his right foot, upon the blood of the trespass
           offering:

03:014:018 And the remnant of the oil that is in the priest's hand he
           shall pour upon the head of him that is to be cleansed: and
           the priest shall make an atonement for him before the LORD.

03:014:019 And the priest shall offer the sin offering, and make an
           atonement for him that is to be cleansed from his uncleanness;
           and afterward he shall kill the burnt offering:

03:014:020 And the priest shall offer the burnt offering and the meat
           offering upon the altar: and the priest shall make an
           atonement for him, and he shall be clean.

03:014:021 And if he be poor, and cannot get so much; then he shall take
           one lamb for a trespass offering to be waved, to make an
           atonement for him, and one tenth deal of fine flour mingled
           with oil for a meat offering, and a log of oil;

03:014:022 And two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, such as he is able
           to get; and the one shall be a sin offering, and the other a
           burnt offering.

03:014:023 And he shall bring them on the eighth day for his cleansing
           unto the priest, unto the door of the tabernacle of the
           congregation, before the LORD.

03:014:024 And the priest shall take the lamb of the trespass offering,
           and the log of oil, and the priest shall wave them for a wave
           offering before the LORD:

03:014:025 And he shall kill the lamb of the trespass offering, and the
           priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass offering,
           and put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be
           cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the
           great toe of his right foot:

03:014:026 And the priest shall pour of the oil into the palm of his own
           left hand:

03:014:027 And the priest shall sprinkle with his right finger some of
           the oil that is in his left hand seven times before the LORD:

03:014:028 And the priest shall put of the oil that is in his hand upon
           the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and
           upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of
           his right foot, upon the place of the blood of the trespass
           offering:

03:014:029 And the rest of the oil that is in the priest's hand he shall
           put upon the head of him that is to be cleansed, to make an
           atonement for him before the LORD.

03:014:030 And he shall offer the one of the turtledoves, or of the young
           pigeons, such as he can get;

03:014:031 Even such as he is able to get, the one for a sin offering,
           and the other for a burnt offering, with the meat offering:
           and the priest shall make an atonement for him that is to be
           cleansed before the LORD.

03:014:032 This is the law of him in whom is the plague of leprosy, whose
           hand is not able to get that which pertaineth to his
           cleansing.

03:014:033 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,

03:014:034 When ye be come into the land of Canaan, which I give to you
           for a possession, and I put the plague of leprosy in a house
           of the land of your possession;

03:014:035 And he that owneth the house shall come and tell the priest,
           saying, It seemeth to me there is as it were a plague in the
           house:

03:014:036 Then the priest shall command that they empty the house,
           before the priest go into it to see the plague, that all that
           is in the house be not made unclean: and afterward the priest
           shall go in to see the house:

03:014:037 And he shall look on the plague, and, behold, if the plague be
           in the walls of the house with hollow strakes, greenish or
           reddish, which in sight are lower than the wall;

03:014:038 Then the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the
           house, and shut up the house seven days:

03:014:039 And the priest shall come again the seventh day, and shall
           look: and, behold, if the plague be spread in the walls of the
           house;

03:014:040 Then the priest shall command that they take away the stones
           in which the plague is, and they shall cast them into an
           unclean place without the city:

03:014:041 And he shall cause the house to be scraped within round about,
           and they shall pour out the dust that they scrape off without
           the city into an unclean place:

03:014:042 And they shall take other stones, and put them in the place of
           those stones; and he shall take other morter, and shall
           plaister the house.

03:014:043 And if the plague come again, and break out in the house,
           after that he hath taken away the stones, and after he hath
           scraped the house, and after it is plaistered;

03:014:044 Then the priest shall come and look, and, behold, if the
           plague be spread in the house, it is a fretting leprosy in the
           house; it is unclean.

03:014:045 And he shall break down the house, the stones of it, and the
           timber thereof, and all the morter of the house; and he shall
           carry them forth out of the city into an unclean place.

03:014:046 Moreover he that goeth into the house all the while that it is
           shut up shall be unclean until the even.

03:014:047 And he that lieth in the house shall wash his clothes; and he
           that eateth in the house shall wash his clothes.

03:014:048 And if the priest shall come in, and look upon it, and,
           behold, the plague hath not spread in the house, after the
           house was plaistered: then the priest shall pronounce the
           house clean, because the plague is healed.

03:014:049 And he shall take to cleanse the house two birds, and cedar
           wood, and scarlet, and hyssop:

03:014:050 And he shall kill the one of the birds in an earthen vessel
           over running water:

03:014:051 And he shall take the cedar wood, and the hyssop, and the
           scarlet, and the living bird, and dip them in the blood of the
           slain bird, and in the running water, and sprinkle the house
           seven times:

03:014:052 And he shall cleanse the house with the blood of the bird, and
           with the running water, and with the living bird, and with the
           cedar wood, and with the hyssop, and with the scarlet:

03:014:053 But he shall let go the living bird out of the city into the
           open fields, and make an atonement for the house: and it shall
           be clean.

03:014:054 This is the law for all manner of plague of leprosy, and
           scall,

03:014:055 And for the leprosy of a garment, and of a house,

03:014:056 And for a rising, and for a scab, and for a bright spot:

03:014:057 To teach when it is unclean, and when it is clean: this is the
           law of leprosy.

03:015:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying,

03:015:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When any
           man hath a running issue out of his flesh, because of his
           issue he is unclean.

03:015:003 And this shall be his uncleanness in his issue: whether his
           flesh run with his issue, or his flesh be stopped from his
           issue, it is his uncleanness.

03:015:004 Every bed, whereon he lieth that hath the issue, is unclean:
           and every thing, whereon he sitteth, shall be unclean.

03:015:005 And whosoever toucheth his bed shall wash his clothes, and
           bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.

03:015:006 And he that sitteth on any thing whereon he sat that hath the
           issue shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and
           be unclean until the even.

03:015:007 And he that toucheth the flesh of him that hath the issue
           shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be
           unclean until the even.

03:015:008 And if he that hath the issue spit upon him that is clean;
           then he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water,
           and be unclean until the even.

03:015:009 And what saddle soever he rideth upon that hath the issue
           shall be unclean.

03:015:010 And whosoever toucheth any thing that was under him shall be
           unclean until the even: and he that beareth any of those
           things shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and
           be unclean until the even.

03:015:011 And whomsoever he toucheth that hath the issue, and hath not
           rinsed his hands in water, he shall wash his clothes, and
           bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.

03:015:012 And the vessel of earth, that he toucheth which hath the
           issue, shall be broken: and every vessel of wood shall be
           rinsed in water.

03:015:013 And when he that hath an issue is cleansed of his issue; then
           he shall number to himself seven days for his cleansing, and
           wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in running water, and
           shall be clean.

03:015:014 And on the eighth day he shall take to him two turtledoves, or
           two young pigeons, and come before the LORD unto the door of
           the tabernacle of the congregation, and give them unto the
           priest:

03:015:015 And the priest shall offer them, the one for a sin offering,
           and the other for a burnt offering; and the priest shall make
           an atonement for him before the LORD for his issue.

03:015:016 And if any man's seed of copulation go out from him, then he
           shall wash all his flesh in water, and be unclean until the
           even.

03:015:017 And every garment, and every skin, whereon is the seed of
           copulation, shall be washed with water, and be unclean until
           the even.

03:015:018 The woman also with whom man shall lie with seed of
           copulation, they shall both bathe themselves in water, and be
           unclean until the even.

03:015:019 And if a woman have an issue, and her issue in her flesh be
           blood, she shall be put apart seven days: and whosoever
           toucheth her shall be unclean until the even.

03:015:020 And every thing that she lieth upon in her separation shall be
           unclean: every thing also that she sitteth upon shall be
           unclean.

03:015:021 And whosoever toucheth her bed shall wash his clothes, and
           bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.

03:015:022 And whosoever toucheth any thing that she sat upon shall wash
           his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until
           the even.

03:015:023 And if it be on her bed, or on any thing whereon she sitteth,
           when he toucheth it, he shall be unclean until the even.

03:015:024 And if any man lie with her at all, and her flowers be upon
           him, he shall be unclean seven days; and all the bed whereon
           he lieth shall be unclean.

03:015:025 And if a woman have an issue of her blood many days out of the
           time of her separation, or if it run beyond the time of her
           separation; all the days of the issue of her uncleanness shall
           be as the days of her separation: she shall be unclean.

03:015:026 Every bed whereon she lieth all the days of her issue shall be
           unto her as the bed of her separation: and whatsoever she
           sitteth upon shall be unclean, as the uncleanness of her
           separation.

03:015:027 And whosoever toucheth those things shall be unclean, and
           shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be
           unclean until the even.

03:015:028 But if she be cleansed of her issue, then she shall number to
           herself seven days, and after that she shall be clean.

03:015:029 And on the eighth day she shall take unto her two turtles, or
           two young pigeons, and bring them unto the priest, to the door
           of the tabernacle of the congregation.

03:015:030 And the priest shall offer the one for a sin offering, and the
           other for a burnt offering; and the priest shall make an
           atonement for her before the LORD for the issue of her
           uncleanness.

03:015:031 Thus shall ye separate the children of Israel from their
           uncleanness; that they die not in their uncleanness, when they
           defile my tabernacle that is among them.

03:015:032 This is the law of him that hath an issue, and of him whose
           seed goeth from him, and is defiled therewith;

03:015:033 And of her that is sick of her flowers, and of him that hath
           an issue, of the man, and of the woman, and of him that lieth
           with her that is unclean.

03:016:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses after the death of the two sons
           of Aaron, when they offered before the LORD, and died;

03:016:002 And the LORD said unto Moses, Speak unto Aaron thy brother,
           that he come not at all times into the holy place within the
           vail before the mercy seat, which is upon the ark; that he die
           not: for I will appear in the cloud upon the mercy seat.

03:016:003 Thus shall Aaron come into the holy place: with a young
           bullock for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering.

03:016:004 He shall put on the holy linen coat, and he shall have the
           linen breeches upon his flesh, and shall be girded with a
           linen girdle, and with the linen mitre shall he be attired:
           these are holy garments; therefore shall he wash his flesh in
           water, and so put them on.

03:016:005 And he shall take of the congregation of the children of
           Israel two kids of the goats for a sin offering, and one ram
           for a burnt offering.

03:016:006 And Aaron shall offer his bullock of the sin offering, which
           is for himself, and make an atonement for himself, and for his
           house.

03:016:007 And he shall take the two goats, and present them before the
           LORD at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.

03:016:008 And Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats; one lot for the
           LORD, and the other lot for the scapegoat.

03:016:009 And Aaron shall bring the goat upon which the LORD's lot fell,
           and offer him for a sin offering.

03:016:010 But the goat, on which the lot fell to be the scapegoat, shall
           be presented alive before the LORD, to make an atonement with
           him, and to let him go for a scapegoat into the wilderness.

03:016:011 And Aaron shall bring the bullock of the sin offering, which
           is for himself, and shall make an atonement for himself, and
           for his house, and shall kill the bullock of the sin offering
           which is for himself:

03:016:012 And he shall take a censer full of burning coals of fire from
           off the altar before the LORD, and his hands full of sweet
           incense beaten small, and bring it within the vail:

03:016:013 And he shall put the incense upon the fire before the LORD,
           that the cloud of the incense may cover the mercy seat that is
           upon the testimony, that he die not:

03:016:014 And he shall take of the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it
           with his finger upon the mercy seat eastward; and before the
           mercy seat shall he sprinkle of the blood with his finger
           seven times.

03:016:015 Then shall he kill the goat of the sin offering, that is for
           the people, and bring his blood within the vail, and do with
           that blood as he did with the blood of the bullock, and
           sprinkle it upon the mercy seat, and before the mercy seat:

03:016:016 And he shall make an atonement for the holy place, because of
           the uncleanness of the children of Israel, and because of
           their transgressions in all their sins: and so shall he do for
           the tabernacle of the congregation, that remaineth among them
           in the midst of their uncleanness.

03:016:017 And there shall be no man in the tabernacle of the
           congregation when he goeth in to make an atonement in the holy
           place, until he come out, and have made an atonement for
           himself, and for his household, and for all the congregation
           of Israel.

03:016:018 And he shall go out unto the altar that is before the LORD,
           and make an atonement for it; and shall take of the blood of
           the bullock, and of the blood of the goat, and put it upon the
           horns of the altar round about.

03:016:019 And he shall sprinkle of the blood upon it with his finger
           seven times, and cleanse it, and hallow it from the
           uncleanness of the children of Israel.

03:016:020 And when he hath made an end of reconciling the holy place,
           and the tabernacle of the congregation, and the altar, he
           shall bring the live goat:

03:016:021 And Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live
           goat, and confess over him all the iniquities of the children
           of Israel, and all their transgressions in all their sins,
           putting them upon the head of the goat, and shall send him
           away by the hand of a fit man into the wilderness:

03:016:022 And the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities unto a
           land not inhabited: and he shall let go the goat in the
           wilderness.

03:016:023 And Aaron shall come into the tabernacle of the congregation,
           and shall put off the linen garments, which he put on when he
           went into the holy place, and shall leave them there:

03:016:024 And he shall wash his flesh with water in the holy place, and
           put on his garments, and come forth, and offer his burnt
           offering, and the burnt offering of the people, and make an
           atonement for himself, and for the people.

03:016:025 And the fat of the sin offering shall he burn upon the altar.

03:016:026 And he that let go the goat for the scapegoat shall wash his
           clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward come into
           the camp.

03:016:027 And the bullock for the sin offering, and the goat for the sin
           offering, whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the
           holy place, shall one carry forth without the camp; and they
           shall burn in the fire their skins, and their flesh, and their
           dung.

03:016:028 And he that burneth them shall wash his clothes, and bathe his
           flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp.

03:016:029 And this shall be a statute for ever unto you: that in the
           seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, ye shall afflict
           your souls, and do no work at all, whether it be one of your
           own country, or a stranger that sojourneth among you:

03:016:030 For on that day shall the priest make an atonement for you, to
           cleanse you, that ye may be clean from all your sins before
           the LORD.

03:016:031 It shall be a sabbath of rest unto you, and ye shall afflict
           your souls, by a statute for ever.

03:016:032 And the priest, whom he shall anoint, and whom he shall
           consecrate to minister in the priest's office in his father's
           stead, shall make the atonement, and shall put on the linen
           clothes, even the holy garments:

03:016:033 And he shall make an atonement for the holy sanctuary, and he
           shall make an atonement for the tabernacle of the
           congregation, and for the altar, and he shall make an
           atonement for the priests, and for all the people of the
           congregation.

03:016:034 And this shall be an everlasting statute unto you, to make an
           atonement for the children of Israel for all their sins once a
           year. And he did as the LORD commanded Moses.

03:017:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

03:017:002 Speak unto Aaron, and unto his sons, and unto all the children
           of Israel, and say unto them; This is the thing which the LORD
           hath commanded, saying,

03:017:003 What man soever there be of the house of Israel, that killeth
           an ox, or lamb, or goat, in the camp, or that killeth it out
           of the camp,

03:017:004 And bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the
           congregation, to offer an offering unto the LORD before the
           tabernacle of the LORD; blood shall be imputed unto that man;
           he hath shed blood; and that man shall be cut off from among
           his people:

03:017:005 To the end that the children of Israel may bring their
           sacrifices, which they offer in the open field, even that they
           may bring them unto the LORD, unto the door of the tabernacle
           of the congregation, unto the priest, and offer them for peace
           offerings unto the LORD.

03:017:006 And the priest shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar of the
           LORD at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and
           burn the fat for a sweet savour unto the LORD.

03:017:007 And they shall no more offer their sacrifices unto devils,
           after whom they have gone a whoring. This shall be a statute
           for ever unto them throughout their generations.

03:017:008 And thou shalt say unto them, Whatsoever man there be of the
           house of Israel, or of the strangers which sojourn among you,
           that offereth a burnt offering or sacrifice,

03:017:009 And bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the
           congregation, to offer it unto the LORD; even that man shall
           be cut off from among his people.

03:017:010 And whatsoever man there be of the house of Israel, or of the
           strangers that sojourn among you, that eateth any manner of
           blood; I will even set my face against that soul that eateth
           blood, and will cut him off from among his people.

03:017:011 For the life of the flesh is in the blood: and I have given it
           to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls: for
           it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul.

03:017:012 Therefore I said unto the children of Israel, No soul of you
           shall eat blood, neither shall any stranger that sojourneth
           among you eat blood.

03:017:013 And whatsoever man there be of the children of Israel, or of
           the strangers that sojourn among you, which hunteth and
           catcheth any beast or fowl that may be eaten; he shall even
           pour out the blood thereof, and cover it with dust.

03:017:014 For it is the life of all flesh; the blood of it is for the
           life thereof: therefore I said unto the children of Israel, Ye
           shall eat the blood of no manner of flesh: for the life of all
           flesh is the blood thereof: whosoever eateth it shall be cut
           off.

03:017:015 And every soul that eateth that which died of itself, or that
           which was torn with beasts, whether it be one of your own
           country, or a stranger, he shall both wash his clothes, and
           bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even: then
           shall he be clean.

03:017:016 But if he wash them not, nor bathe his flesh; then he shall
           bear his iniquity.

03:018:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

03:018:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, I am the
           LORD your God.

03:018:003 After the doings of the land of Egypt, wherein ye dwelt, shall
           ye not do: and after the doings of the land of Canaan, whither
           I bring you, shall ye not do: neither shall ye walk in their
           ordinances.

03:018:004 Ye shall do my judgments, and keep mine ordinances, to walk
           therein: I am the LORD your God.

03:018:005 Ye shall therefore keep my statutes, and my judgments: which
           if a man do, he shall live in them: I am the LORD.

03:018:006 None of you shall approach to any that is near of kin to him,
           to uncover their nakedness: I am the LORD.

03:018:007 The nakedness of thy father, or the nakedness of thy mother,
           shalt thou not uncover: she is thy mother; thou shalt not
           uncover her nakedness.

03:018:008 The nakedness of thy father's wife shalt thou not uncover: it
           is thy father's nakedness.

03:018:009 The nakedness of thy sister, the daughter of thy father, or
           daughter of thy mother, whether she be born at home, or born
           abroad, even their nakedness thou shalt not uncover.

03:018:010 The nakedness of thy son's daughter, or of thy daughter's
           daughter, even their nakedness thou shalt not uncover: for
           theirs is thine own nakedness.

03:018:011 The nakedness of thy father's wife's daughter, begotten of thy
           father, she is thy sister, thou shalt not uncover her
           nakedness.

03:018:012 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father's sister:
           she is thy father's near kinswoman.

03:018:013 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother's sister:
           for she is thy mother's near kinswoman.

03:018:014 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father's brother,
           thou shalt not approach to his wife: she is thine aunt.

03:018:015 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy daughter in law:
           she is thy son's wife; thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.

03:018:016 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy brother's wife: it
           is thy brother's nakedness.

03:018:017 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her
           daughter, neither shalt thou take her son's daughter, or her
           daughter's daughter, to uncover her nakedness; for they are
           her near kinswomen: it is wickedness.

03:018:018 Neither shalt thou take a wife to her sister, to vex her, to
           uncover her nakedness, beside the other in her life time.

03:018:019 Also thou shalt not approach unto a woman to uncover her
           nakedness, as long as she is put apart for her uncleanness.

03:018:020 Moreover thou shalt not lie carnally with thy neighbour's
           wife, to defile thyself with her.

03:018:021 And thou shalt not let any of thy seed pass through the fire
           to Molech, neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God: I
           am the LORD.

03:018:022 Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is
           abomination.

03:018:023 Neither shalt thou lie with any beast to defile thyself
           therewith: neither shall any woman stand before a beast to lie
           down thereto: it is confusion.

03:018:024 Defile not ye yourselves in any of these things: for in all
           these the nations are defiled which I cast out before you:

03:018:025 And the land is defiled: therefore I do visit the iniquity
           thereof upon it, and the land itself vomiteth out her
           inhabitants.

03:018:026 Ye shall therefore keep my statutes and my judgments, and
           shall not commit any of these abominations; neither any of
           your own nation, nor any stranger that sojourneth among you:

03:018:027 (For all these abominations have the men of the land done,
           which were before you, and the land is defiled;)

03:018:028 That the land spue not you out also, when ye defile it, as it
           spued out the nations that were before you.

03:018:029 For whosoever shall commit any of these abominations, even the
           souls that commit them shall be cut off from among their
           people.

03:018:030 Therefore shall ye keep mine ordinance, that ye commit not any
           one of these abominable customs, which were committed before
           you, and that ye defile not yourselves therein: I am the LORD
           your God.

03:019:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

03:019:002 Speak unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, and
           say unto them, Ye shall be holy: for I the LORD your God am
           holy.

03:019:003 Ye shall fear every man his mother, and his father, and keep
           my sabbaths: I am the LORD your God.

03:019:004 Turn ye not unto idols, nor make to yourselves molten gods: I
           am the LORD your God.

03:019:005 And if ye offer a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the LORD,
           ye shall offer it at your own will.

03:019:006 It shall be eaten the same day ye offer it, and on the morrow:
           and if ought remain until the third day, it shall be burnt in
           the fire.

03:019:007 And if it be eaten at all on the third day, it is abominable;
           it shall not be accepted.

03:019:008 Therefore every one that eateth it shall bear his iniquity,
           because he hath profaned the hallowed thing of the LORD: and
           that soul shall be cut off from among his people.

03:019:009 And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not
           wholly reap the corners of thy field, neither shalt thou
           gather the gleanings of thy harvest.

03:019:010 And thou shalt not glean thy vineyard, neither shalt thou
           gather every grape of thy vineyard; thou shalt leave them for
           the poor and stranger: I am the LORD your God.

03:019:011 Ye shall not steal, neither deal falsely, neither lie one to
           another.

03:019:012 And ye shall not swear by my name falsely, neither shalt thou
           profane the name of thy God: I am the LORD.

03:019:013 Thou shalt not defraud thy neighbour, neither rob him: the
           wages of him that is hired shall not abide with thee all night
           until the morning.

03:019:014 Thou shalt not curse the deaf, nor put a stumblingblock before
           the blind, but shalt fear thy God: I am the LORD.

03:019:015 Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment: thou shalt not
           respect the person of the poor, nor honor the person of the
           mighty: but in righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbour.

03:019:016 Thou shalt not go up and down as a talebearer among thy
           people: neither shalt thou stand against the blood of thy
           neighbour; I am the LORD.

03:019:017 Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart: thou shalt in
           any wise rebuke thy neighbour, and not suffer sin upon him.

03:019:018 Thou shalt not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the
           children of thy people, but thou shalt love thy neighbour as
           thyself: I am the LORD.

03:019:019 Ye shall keep my statutes. Thou shalt not let thy cattle
           gender with a diverse kind: thou shalt not sow thy field with
           mingled seed: neither shall a garment mingled of linen and
           woollen come upon thee.

03:019:020 And whosoever lieth carnally with a woman, that is a bondmaid,
           betrothed to an husband, and not at all redeemed, nor freedom
           given her; she shall be scourged; they shall not be put to
           death, because she was not free.

03:019:021 And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD, unto
           the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, even a ram for
           a trespass offering.

03:019:022 And the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of
           the trespass offering before the LORD for his sin which he
           hath done: and the sin which he hath done shall be forgiven
           him.

03:019:023 And when ye shall come into the land, and shall have planted
           all manner of trees for food, then ye shall count the fruit
           thereof as uncircumcised: three years shall it be as
           uncircumcised unto you: it shall not be eaten of.

03:019:024 But in the fourth year all the fruit thereof shall be holy to
           praise the LORD withal.

03:019:025 And in the fifth year shall ye eat of the fruit thereof, that
           it may yield unto you the increase thereof: I am the LORD your
           God.

03:019:026 Ye shall not eat any thing with the blood: neither shall ye
           use enchantment, nor observe times.

03:019:027 Ye shall not round the corners of your heads, neither shalt
           thou mar the corners of thy beard.

03:019:028 Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor
           print any marks upon you: I am the LORD.

03:019:029 Do not prostitute thy daughter, to cause her to be a whore;
           lest the land fall to whoredom, and the land become full of
           wickedness.

03:019:030 Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am
           the LORD.

03:019:031 Regard not them that have familiar spirits, neither seek after
           wizards, to be defiled by them: I am the LORD your God.

03:019:032 Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head, and honour the face
           of the old man, and fear thy God: I am the LORD.

03:019:033 And if a stranger sojourn with thee in your land, ye shall not
           vex him.

03:019:034 But the stranger that dwelleth with you shall be unto you as
           one born among you, and thou shalt love him as thyself; for ye
           were strangers in the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.

03:019:035 Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in meteyard, in
           weight, or in measure.

03:019:036 Just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin,
           shall ye have: I am the LORD your God, which brought you out
           of the land of Egypt.

03:019:037 Therefore shall ye observe all my statutes, and all my
           judgments, and do them: I am the LORD.

03:020:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

03:020:002 Again, thou shalt say to the children of Israel, Whosoever he
           be of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn
           in Israel, that giveth any of his seed unto Molech; he shall
           surely be put to death: the people of the land shall stone him
           with stones.

03:020:003 And I will set my face against that man, and will cut him off
           from among his people; because he hath given of his seed unto
           Molech, to defile my sanctuary, and to profane my holy name.

03:020:004 And if the people of the land do any ways hide their eyes from
           the man, when he giveth of his seed unto Molech, and kill him
           not:

03:020:005 Then I will set my face against that man, and against his
           family, and will cut him off, and all that go a whoring after
           him, to commit whoredom with Molech, from among their people.

03:020:006 And the soul that turneth after such as have familiar spirits,
           and after wizards, to go a whoring after them, I will even set
           my face against that soul, and will cut him off from among his
           people.

03:020:007 Sanctify yourselves therefore, and be ye holy: for I am the
           LORD your God.

03:020:008 And ye shall keep my statutes, and do them: I am the LORD
           which sanctify you.

03:020:009 For every one that curseth his father or his mother shall be
           surely put to death: he hath cursed his father or his mother;
           his blood shall be upon him.

03:020:010 And the man that committeth adultery with another man's wife,
           even he that committeth adultery with his neighbour's wife,
           the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death.

03:020:011 And the man that lieth with his father's wife hath uncovered
           his father's nakedness: both of them shall surely be put to
           death; their blood shall be upon them.

03:020:012 And if a man lie with his daughter in law, both of them shall
           surely be put to death: they have wrought confusion; their
           blood shall be upon them.

03:020:013 If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both
           of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be
           put to death; their blood shall be upon them.

03:020:014 And if a man take a wife and her mother, it is wickedness:
           they shall be burnt with fire, both he and they; that there be
           no wickedness among you.

03:020:015 And if a man lie with a beast, he shall surely be put to
           death: and ye shall slay the beast.

03:020:016 And if a woman approach unto any beast, and lie down thereto,
           thou shalt kill the woman, and the beast: they shall surely be
           put to death; their blood shall be upon them.

03:020:017 And if a man shall take his sister, his father's daughter, or
           his mother's daughter, and see her nakedness, and she see his
           nakedness; it is a wicked thing; and they shall be cut off in
           the sight of their people: he hath uncovered his sister's
           nakedness; he shall bear his iniquity.

03:020:018 And if a man shall lie with a woman having her sickness, and
           shall uncover her nakedness; he hath discovered her fountain,
           and she hath uncovered the fountain of her blood: and both of
           them shall be cut off from among their people.

03:020:019 And thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother's
           sister, nor of thy father's sister: for he uncovereth his near
           kin: they shall bear their iniquity.

03:020:020 And if a man shall lie with his uncle's wife, he hath
           uncovered his uncle's nakedness: they shall bear their sin;
           they shall die childless.

03:020:021 And if a man shall take his brother's wife, it is an unclean
           thing: he hath uncovered his brother's nakedness; they shall
           be childless.

03:020:022 Ye shall therefore keep all my statutes, and all my judgments,
           and do them: that the land, whither I bring you to dwell
           therein, spue you not out.

03:020:023 And ye shall not walk in the manners of the nation, which I
           cast out before you: for they committed all these things, and
           therefore I abhorred them.

03:020:024 But I have said unto you, Ye shall inherit their land, and I
           will give it unto you to possess it, a land that floweth with
           milk and honey: I am the LORD your God, which have separated
           you from other people.

03:020:025 Ye shall therefore put difference between clean beasts and
           unclean, and between unclean fowls and clean: and ye shall not
           make your souls abominable by beast, or by fowl, or by any
           manner of living thing that creepeth on the ground, which I
           have separated from you as unclean.

03:020:026 And ye shall be holy unto me: for I the LORD am holy, and have
           severed you from other people, that ye should be mine.

03:020:027 A man also or woman that hath a familiar spirit, or that is a
           wizard, shall surely be put to death: they shall stone them
           with stones: their blood shall be upon them.

03:021:001 And the LORD said unto Moses, Speak unto the priests the sons
           of Aaron, and say unto them, There shall none be defiled for
           the dead among his people:

03:021:002 But for his kin, that is near unto him, that is, for his
           mother, and for his father, and for his son, and for his
           daughter, and for his brother.

03:021:003 And for his sister a virgin, that is nigh unto him, which hath
           had no husband; for her may he be defiled.

03:021:004 But he shall not defile himself, being a chief man among his
           people, to profane himself.

03:021:005 They shall not make baldness upon their head, neither shall
           they shave off the corner of their beard, nor make any
           cuttings in their flesh.

03:021:006 They shall be holy unto their God, and not profane the name of
           their God: for the offerings of the LORD made by fire, and the
           bread of their God, they do offer: therefore they shall be
           holy.

03:021:007 They shall not take a wife that is a whore, or profane;
           neither shall they take a woman put away from her husband: for
           he is holy unto his God.

03:021:008 Thou shalt sanctify him therefore; for he offereth the bread
           of thy God: he shall be holy unto thee: for I the LORD, which
           sanctify you, am holy.

03:021:009 And the daughter of any priest, if she profane herself by
           playing the whore, she profaneth her father: she shall be
           burnt with fire.

03:021:010 And he that is the high priest among his brethren, upon whose
           head the anointing oil was poured, and that is consecrated to
           put on the garments, shall not uncover his head, nor rend his
           clothes;

03:021:011 Neither shall he go in to any dead body, nor defile himself
           for his father, or for his mother;

03:021:012 Neither shall he go out of the sanctuary, nor profane the
           sanctuary of his God; for the crown of the anointing oil of
           his God is upon him: I am the LORD.

03:021:013 And he shall take a wife in her virginity.

03:021:014 A widow, or a divorced woman, or profane, or an harlot, these
           shall he not take: but he shall take a virgin of his own
           people to wife.

03:021:015 Neither shall he profane his seed among his people: for I the
           LORD do sanctify him.

03:021:016 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

03:021:017 Speak unto Aaron, saying, Whosoever he be of thy seed in their
           generations that hath any blemish, let him not approach to
           offer the bread of his God.

03:021:018 For whatsoever man he be that hath a blemish, he shall not
           approach: a blind man, or a lame, or he that hath a flat nose,
           or any thing superfluous,

03:021:019 Or a man that is brokenfooted, or brokenhanded,

03:021:020 Or crookbackt, or a dwarf, or that hath a blemish in his eye,
           or be scurvy, or scabbed, or hath his stones broken;

03:021:021 No man that hath a blemish of the seed of Aaron the priest
           shall come nigh to offer the offerings of the LORD made by
           fire: he hath a blemish; he shall not come nigh to offer the
           bread of his God.

03:021:022 He shall eat the bread of his God, both of the most holy, and
           of the holy.

03:021:023 Only he shall not go in unto the vail, nor come nigh unto the
           altar, because he hath a blemish; that he profane not my
           sanctuaries: for I the LORD do sanctify them.

03:021:024 And Moses told it unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all
           the children of Israel.

03:022:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

03:022:002 Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, that they separate
           themselves from the holy things of the children of Israel, and
           that they profane not my holy name in those things which they
           hallow unto me: I am the LORD.

03:022:003 Say unto them, Whosoever he be of all your seed among your
           generations, that goeth unto the holy things, which the
           children of Israel hallow unto the LORD, having his
           uncleanness upon him, that soul shall be cut off from my
           presence: I am the LORD.

03:022:004 What man soever of the seed of Aaron is a leper, or hath a
           running issue; he shall not eat of the holy things, until he
           be clean. And whoso toucheth any thing that is unclean by the
           dead, or a man whose seed goeth from him;

03:022:005 Or whosoever toucheth any creeping thing, whereby he may be
           made unclean, or a man of whom he may take uncleanness,
           whatsoever uncleanness he hath;

03:022:006 The soul which hath touched any such shall be unclean until
           even, and shall not eat of the holy things, unless he wash his
           flesh with water.

03:022:007 And when the sun is down, he shall be clean, and shall
           afterward eat of the holy things; because it is his food.

03:022:008 That which dieth of itself, or is torn with beasts, he shall
           not eat to defile himself therewith; I am the LORD.

03:022:009 They shall therefore keep mine ordinance, lest they bear sin
           for it, and die therefore, if they profane it: I the LORD do
           sanctify them.

03:022:010 There shall no stranger eat of the holy thing: a sojourner of
           the priest, or an hired servant, shall not eat of the holy
           thing.

03:022:011 But if the priest buy any soul with his money, he shall eat of
           it, and he that is born in his house: they shall eat of his
           meat.

03:022:012 If the priest's daughter also be married unto a stranger, she
           may not eat of an offering of the holy things.

03:022:013 But if the priest's daughter be a widow, or divorced, and have
           no child, and is returned unto her father's house, as in her
           youth, she shall eat of her father's meat: but there shall be
           no stranger eat thereof.

03:022:014 And if a man eat of the holy thing unwittingly, then he shall
           put the fifth part thereof unto it, and shall give it unto the
           priest with the holy thing.

03:022:015 And they shall not profane the holy things of the children of
           Israel, which they offer unto the LORD;

03:022:016 Or suffer them to bear the iniquity of trespass, when they eat
           their holy things: for I the LORD do sanctify them.

03:022:017 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

03:022:018 Speak unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the children
           of Israel, and say unto them, Whatsoever he be of the house of
           Israel, or of the strangers in Israel, that will offer his
           oblation for all his vows, and for all his freewill offerings,
           which they will offer unto the LORD for a burnt offering;

03:022:019 Ye shall offer at your own will a male without blemish, of the
           beeves, of the sheep, or of the goats.

03:022:020 But whatsoever hath a blemish, that shall ye not offer: for it
           shall not be acceptable for you.

03:022:021 And whosoever offereth a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the
           LORD to accomplish his vow, or a freewill offering in beeves
           or sheep, it shall be perfect to be accepted; there shall be
           no blemish therein.

03:022:022 Blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a wen, or scurvy, or
           scabbed, ye shall not offer these unto the LORD, nor make an
           offering by fire of them upon the altar unto the LORD.

03:022:023 Either a bullock or a lamb that hath any thing superfluous or
           lacking in his parts, that mayest thou offer for a freewill
           offering; but for a vow it shall not be accepted.

03:022:024 Ye shall not offer unto the LORD that which is bruised, or
           crushed, or broken, or cut; neither shall ye make any offering
           thereof in your land.

03:022:025 Neither from a stranger's hand shall ye offer the bread of
           your God of any of these; because their corruption is in them,
           and blemishes be in them: they shall not be accepted for you.

03:022:026 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

03:022:027 When a bullock, or a sheep, or a goat, is brought forth, then
           it shall be seven days under the dam; and from the eighth day
           and thenceforth it shall be accepted for an offering made by
           fire unto the LORD.

03:022:028 And whether it be cow, or ewe, ye shall not kill it and her
           young both in one day.

03:022:029 And when ye will offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving unto the
           LORD, offer it at your own will.

03:022:030 On the same day it shall be eaten up; ye shall leave none of
           it until the morrow: I am the LORD.

03:022:031 Therefore shall ye keep my commandments, and do them: I am the
           LORD.

03:022:032 Neither shall ye profane my holy name; but I will be hallowed
           among the children of Israel: I am the LORD which hallow you,

03:022:033 That brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I
           am the LORD.

03:023:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

03:023:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them,
           Concerning the feasts of the LORD, which ye shall proclaim to
           be holy convocations, even these are my feasts.

03:023:003 Six days shall work be done: but the seventh day is the
           sabbath of rest, an holy convocation; ye shall do no work
           therein: it is the sabbath of the LORD in all your dwellings.

03:023:004 These are the feasts of the LORD, even holy convocations,
           which ye shall proclaim in their seasons.

03:023:005 In the fourteenth day of the first month at even is the LORD's
           passover.

03:023:006 And on the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of
           unleavened bread unto the LORD: seven days ye must eat
           unleavened bread.

03:023:007 In the first day ye shall have an holy convocation: ye shall
           do no servile work therein.

03:023:008 But ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD
           seven days: in the seventh day is an holy convocation: ye
           shall do no servile work therein.

03:023:009 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

03:023:010 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye
           be come into the land which I give unto you, and shall reap
           the harvest thereof, then ye shall bring a sheaf of the
           firstfruits of your harvest unto the priest:

03:023:011 And he shall wave the sheaf before the LORD, to be accepted
           for you: on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave
           it.

03:023:012 And ye shall offer that day when ye wave the sheaf an he lamb
           without blemish of the first year for a burnt offering unto
           the LORD.

03:023:013 And the meat offering thereof shall be two tenth deals of fine
           flour mingled with oil, an offering made by fire unto the LORD
           for a sweet savour: and the drink offering thereof shall be of
           wine, the fourth part of an hin.

03:023:014 And ye shall eat neither bread, nor parched corn, nor green
           ears, until the selfsame day that ye have brought an offering
           unto your God: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your
           generations in all your dwellings.

03:023:015 And ye shall count unto you from the morrow after the sabbath,
           from the day that ye brought the sheaf of the wave offering;
           seven sabbaths shall be complete:

03:023:016 Even unto the morrow after the seventh sabbath shall ye number
           fifty days; and ye shall offer a new meat offering unto the
           LORD.

03:023:017 Ye shall bring out of your habitations two wave loaves of two
           tenth deals; they shall be of fine flour; they shall be baken
           with leaven; they are the firstfruits unto the LORD.

03:023:018 And ye shall offer with the bread seven lambs without blemish
           of the first year, and one young bullock, and two rams: they
           shall be for a burnt offering unto the LORD, with their meat
           offering, and their drink offerings, even an offering made by
           fire, of sweet savour unto the LORD.

03:023:019 Then ye shall sacrifice one kid of the goats for a sin
           offering, and two lambs of the first year for a sacrifice of
           peace offerings.

03:023:020 And the priest shall wave them with the bread of the
           firstfruits for a wave offering before the LORD, with the two
           lambs: they shall be holy to the LORD for the priest.

03:023:021 And ye shall proclaim on the selfsame day, that it may be an
           holy convocation unto you: ye shall do no servile work
           therein: it shall be a statute for ever in all your dwellings
           throughout your generations.

03:023:022 And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not make
           clean riddance of the corners of thy field when thou reapest,
           neither shalt thou gather any gleaning of thy harvest: thou
           shalt leave them unto the poor, and to the stranger: I am the
           LORD your God.

03:023:023 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

03:023:024 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, In the seventh
           month, in the first day of the month, shall ye have a sabbath,
           a memorial of blowing of trumpets, an holy convocation.

03:023:025 Ye shall do no servile work therein: but ye shall offer an
           offering made by fire unto the LORD.

03:023:026 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

03:023:027 Also on the tenth day of this seventh month there shall be a
           day of atonement: it shall be an holy convocation unto you;
           and ye shall afflict your souls, and offer an offering made by
           fire unto the LORD.

03:023:028 And ye shall do no work in that same day: for it is a day of
           atonement, to make an atonement for you before the LORD your
           God.

03:023:029 For whatsoever soul it be that shall not be afflicted in that
           same day, he shall be cut off from among his people.

03:023:030 And whatsoever soul it be that doeth any work in that same
           day, the same soul will I destroy from among his people.

03:023:031 Ye shall do no manner of work: it shall be a statute for ever
           throughout your generations in all your dwellings.

03:023:032 It shall be unto you a sabbath of rest, and ye shall afflict
           your souls: in the ninth day of the month at even, from even
           unto even, shall ye celebrate your sabbath.

03:023:033 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

03:023:034 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, The fifteenth day
           of this seventh month shall be the feast of tabernacles for
           seven days unto the LORD.

03:023:035 On the first day shall be an holy convocation: ye shall do no
           servile work therein.

03:023:036 Seven days ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the
           LORD: on the eighth day shall be an holy convocation unto you;
           and ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD: it
           is a solemn assembly; and ye shall do no servile work therein.

03:023:037 These are the feasts of the LORD, which ye shall proclaim to
           be holy convocations, to offer an offering made by fire unto
           the LORD, a burnt offering, and a meat offering, a sacrifice,
           and drink offerings, every thing upon his day:

03:023:038 Beside the sabbaths of the LORD, and beside your gifts, and
           beside all your vows, and beside all your freewill offerings,
           which ye give unto the LORD.

03:023:039 Also in the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when ye have
           gathered in the fruit of the land, ye shall keep a feast unto
           the LORD seven days: on the first day shall be a sabbath, and
           on the eighth day shall be a sabbath.

03:023:040 And ye shall take you on the first day the boughs of goodly
           trees, branches of palm trees, and the boughs of thick trees,
           and willows of the brook; and ye shall rejoice before the LORD
           your God seven days.

03:023:041 And ye shall keep it a feast unto the LORD seven days in the
           year. It shall be a statute for ever in your generations: ye
           shall celebrate it in the seventh month.

03:023:042 Ye shall dwell in booths seven days; all that are Israelites
           born shall dwell in booths:

03:023:043 That your generations may know that I made the children of
           Israel to dwell in booths, when I brought them out of the land
           of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.

03:023:044 And Moses declared unto the children of Israel the feasts of
           the LORD.

03:024:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

03:024:002 Command the children of Israel, that they bring unto thee pure
           oil olive beaten for the light, to cause the lamps to burn
           continually.

03:024:003 Without the vail of the testimony, in the tabernacle of the
           congregation, shall Aaron order it from the evening unto the
           morning before the LORD continually: it shall be a statute for
           ever in your generations.

03:024:004 He shall order the lamps upon the pure candlestick before the
           LORD continually.

03:024:005 And thou shalt take fine flour, and bake twelve cakes thereof:
           two tenth deals shall be in one cake.

03:024:006 And thou shalt set them in two rows, six on a row, upon the
           pure table before the LORD.

03:024:007 And thou shalt put pure frankincense upon each row, that it
           may be on the bread for a memorial, even an offering made by
           fire unto the LORD.

03:024:008 Every sabbath he shall set it in order before the LORD
           continually, being taken from the children of Israel by an
           everlasting covenant.

03:024:009 And it shall be Aaron's and his sons'; and they shall eat it
           in the holy place: for it is most holy unto him of the
           offerings of the LORD made by fire by a perpetual statute.

03:024:010 And the son of an Israelitish woman, whose father was an
           Egyptian, went out among the children of Israel: and this son
           of the Israelitish woman and a man of Israel strove together
           in the camp;

03:024:011 And the Israelitish woman's son blasphemed the name of the
           Lord, and cursed. And they brought him unto Moses: (and his
           mother's name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the
           tribe of Dan:)

03:024:012 And they put him in ward, that the mind of the LORD might be
           shewed them.

03:024:013 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

03:024:014 Bring forth him that hath cursed without the camp; and let all
           that heard him lay their hands upon his head, and let all the
           congregation stone him.

03:024:015 And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying,
           Whosoever curseth his God shall bear his sin.

03:024:016 And he that blasphemeth the name of the LORD, he shall surely
           be put to death, and all the congregation shall certainly
           stone him: as well the stranger, as he that is born in the
           land, when he blasphemeth the name of the Lord, shall be put
           to death.

03:024:017 And he that killeth any man shall surely be put to death.

03:024:018 And he that killeth a beast shall make it good; beast for
           beast.

03:024:019 And if a man cause a blemish in his neighbour; as he hath
           done, so shall it be done to him;

03:024:020 Breach for breach, eye for eye, tooth for tooth: as he hath
           caused a blemish in a man, so shall it be done to him again.

03:024:021 And he that killeth a beast, he shall restore it: and he that
           killeth a man, he shall be put to death.

03:024:022 Ye shall have one manner of law, as well for the stranger, as
           for one of your own country: for I am the LORD your God.

03:024:023 And Moses spake to the children of Israel, that they should
           bring forth him that had cursed out of the camp, and stone him
           with stones. And the children of Israel did as the LORD
           commanded Moses.

03:025:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses in mount Sinai, saying,

03:025:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye
           come into the land which I give you, then shall the land keep
           a sabbath unto the LORD.

03:025:003 Six years thou shalt sow thy field, and six years thou shalt
           prune thy vineyard, and gather in the fruit thereof;

03:025:004 But in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest unto the
           land, a sabbath for the LORD: thou shalt neither sow thy
           field, nor prune thy vineyard.

03:025:005 That which groweth of its own accord of thy harvest thou shalt
           not reap, neither gather the grapes of thy vine undressed: for
           it is a year of rest unto the land.

03:025:006 And the sabbath of the land shall be meat for you; for thee,
           and for thy servant, and for thy maid, and for thy hired
           servant, and for thy stranger that sojourneth with thee.

03:025:007 And for thy cattle, and for the beast that are in thy land,
           shall all the increase thereof be meat.

03:025:008 And thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee, seven
           times seven years; and the space of the seven sabbaths of
           years shall be unto thee forty and nine years.

03:025:009 Then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubile to sound on
           the tenth day of the seventh month, in the day of atonement
           shall ye make the trumpet sound throughout all your land.

03:025:010 And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty
           throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it
           shall be a jubile unto you; and ye shall return every man unto
           his possession, and ye shall return every man unto his family.

03:025:011 A jubile shall that fiftieth year be unto you: ye shall not
           sow, neither reap that which groweth of itself in it, nor
           gather the grapes in it of thy vine undressed.

03:025:012 For it is the jubile; it shall be holy unto you: ye shall eat
           the increase thereof out of the field.

03:025:013 In the year of this jubile ye shall return every man unto his
           possession.

03:025:014 And if thou sell ought unto thy neighbour, or buyest ought of
           thy neighbour's hand, ye shall not oppress one another:

03:025:015 According to the number of years after the jubile thou shalt
           buy of thy neighbour, and according unto the number of years
           of the fruits he shall sell unto thee:

03:025:016 According to the multitude of years thou shalt increase the
           price thereof, and according to the fewness of years thou
           shalt diminish the price of it: for according to the number of
           the years of the fruits doth he sell unto thee.

03:025:017 Ye shall not therefore oppress one another; but thou shalt
           fear thy God: for I am the LORD your God.

03:025:018 Wherefore ye shall do my statutes, and keep my judgments, and
           do them; and ye shall dwell in the land in safety.

03:025:019 And the land shall yield her fruit, and ye shall eat your
           fill, and dwell therein in safety.

03:025:020 And if ye shall say, What shall we eat the seventh year?
           behold, we shall not sow, nor gather in our increase:

03:025:021 Then I will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year,
           and it shall bring forth fruit for three years.

03:025:022 And ye shall sow the eighth year, and eat yet of old fruit
           until the ninth year; until her fruits come in ye shall eat of
           the old store.

03:025:023 The land shall not be sold for ever: for the land is mine, for
           ye are strangers and sojourners with me.

03:025:024 And in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a
           redemption for the land.

03:025:025 If thy brother be waxen poor, and hath sold away some of his
           possession, and if any of his kin come to redeem it, then
           shall he redeem that which his brother sold.

03:025:026 And if the man have none to redeem it, and himself be able to
           redeem it;

03:025:027 Then let him count the years of the sale thereof, and restore
           the overplus unto the man to whom he sold it; that he may
           return unto his possession.

03:025:028 But if he be not able to restore it to him, then that which is
           sold shall remain in the hand of him that hath bought it until
           the year of jubile: and in the jubile it shall go out, and he
           shall return unto his possession.

03:025:029 And if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled city, then he
           may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold; within a
           full year may he redeem it.

03:025:030 And if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year,
           then the house that is in the walled city shall be established
           for ever to him that bought it throughout his generations: it
           shall not go out in the jubile.

03:025:031 But the houses of the villages which have no wall round about
           them shall be counted as the fields of the country: they may
           be redeemed, and they shall go out in the jubile.

03:025:032 Notwithstanding the cities of the Levites, and the houses of
           the cities of their possession, may the Levites redeem at any
           time.

03:025:033 And if a man purchase of the Levites, then the house that was
           sold, and the city of his possession, shall go out in the year
           of jubile: for the houses of the cities of the Levites are
           their possession among the children of Israel.

03:025:034 But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold;
           for it is their perpetual possession.

03:025:035 And if thy brother be waxen poor, and fallen in decay with
           thee; then thou shalt relieve him: yea, though he be a
           stranger, or a sojourner; that he may live with thee.

03:025:036 Take thou no usury of him, or increase: but fear thy God; that
           thy brother may live with thee.

03:025:037 Thou shalt not give him thy money upon usury, nor lend him thy
           victuals for increase.

03:025:038 I am the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the
           land of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan, and to be your
           God.

03:025:039 And if thy brother that dwelleth by thee be waxen poor, and be
           sold unto thee; thou shalt not compel him to serve as a
           bondservant:

03:025:040 But as an hired servant, and as a sojourner, he shall be with
           thee, and shall serve thee unto the year of jubile.

03:025:041 And then shall he depart from thee, both he and his children
           with him, and shall return unto his own family, and unto the
           possession of his fathers shall he return.

03:025:042 For they are my servants, which I brought forth out of the
           land of Egypt: they shall not be sold as bondmen.

03:025:043 Thou shalt not rule over him with rigour; but shalt fear thy
           God.

03:025:044 Both thy bondmen, and thy bondmaids, which thou shalt have,
           shall be of the heathen that are round about you; of them
           shall ye buy bondmen and bondmaids.

03:025:045 Moreover of the children of the strangers that do sojourn
           among you, of them shall ye buy, and of their families that
           are with you, which they begat in your land: and they shall be
           your possession.

03:025:046 And ye shall take them as an inheritance for your children
           after you, to inherit them for a possession; they shall be
           your bondmen for ever: but over your brethren the children of
           Israel, ye shall not rule one over another with rigour.

03:025:047 And if a sojourner or stranger wax rich by thee, and thy
           brother that dwelleth by him wax poor, and sell himself unto
           the stranger or sojourner by thee, or to the stock of the
           stranger's family:

03:025:048 After that he is sold he may be redeemed again; one of his
           brethren may redeem him:

03:025:049 Either his uncle, or his uncle's son, may redeem him, or any
           that is nigh of kin unto him of his family may redeem him; or
           if he be able, he may redeem himself.

03:025:050 And he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year
           that he was sold to him unto the year of jubile: and the price
           of his sale shall be according unto the number of years,
           according to the time of an hired servant shall it be with
           him.

03:025:051 If there be yet many years behind, according unto them he
           shall give again the price of his redemption out of the money
           that he was bought for.

03:025:052 And if there remain but few years unto the year of jubile,
           then he shall count with him, and according unto his years
           shall he give him again the price of his redemption.

03:025:053 And as a yearly hired servant shall he be with him: and the
           other shall not rule with rigour over him in thy sight.

03:025:054 And if he be not redeemed in these years, then he shall go out
           in the year of jubile, both he, and his children with him.

03:025:055 For unto me the children of Israel are servants; they are my
           servants whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: I am
           the LORD your God.

03:026:001 Ye shall make you no idols nor graven image, neither rear you
           up a standing image, neither shall ye set up any image of
           stone in your land, to bow down unto it: for I am the LORD
           your God.

03:026:002 Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am
           the LORD.

03:026:003 If ye walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments, and do
           them;

03:026:004 Then I will give you rain in due season, and the land shall
           yield her increase, and the trees of the field shall yield
           their fruit.

03:026:005 And your threshing shall reach unto the vintage, and the
           vintage shall reach unto the sowing time: and ye shall eat
           your bread to the full, and dwell in your land safely.

03:026:006 And I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, and
           none shall make you afraid: and I will rid evil beasts out of
           the land, neither shall the sword go through your land.

03:026:007 And ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before
           you by the sword.

03:026:008 And five of you shall chase an hundred, and an hundred of you
           shall put ten thousand to flight: and your enemies shall fall
           before you by the sword.

03:026:009 For I will have respect unto you, and make you fruitful, and
           multiply you, and establish my covenant with you.

03:026:010 And ye shall eat old store, and bring forth the old because of
           the new.

03:026:011 And I set my tabernacle among you: and my soul shall not abhor
           you.

03:026:012 And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye shall
           be my people.

03:026:013 I am the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the
           land of Egypt, that ye should not be their bondmen; and I have
           broken the bands of your yoke, and made you go upright.

03:026:014 But if ye will not hearken unto me, and will not do all these
           commandments;

03:026:015 And if ye shall despise my statutes, or if your soul abhor my
           judgments, so that ye will not do all my commandments, but
           that ye break my covenant:

03:026:016 I also will do this unto you; I will even appoint over you
           terror, consumption, and the burning ague, that shall consume
           the eyes, and cause sorrow of heart: and ye shall sow your
           seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it.

03:026:017 And I will set my face against you, and ye shall be slain
           before your enemies: they that hate you shall reign over you;
           and ye shall flee when none pursueth you.

03:026:018 And if ye will not yet for all this hearken unto me, then I
           will punish you seven times more for your sins.

03:026:019 And I will break the pride of your power; and I will make your
           heaven as iron, and your earth as brass:

03:026:020 And your strength shall be spent in vain: for your land shall
           not yield her increase, neither shall the trees of the land
           yield their fruits.

03:026:021 And if ye walk contrary unto me, and will not hearken unto me;
           I will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to
           your sins.

03:026:022 I will also send wild beasts among you, which shall rob you of
           your children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in
           number; and your high ways shall be desolate.

03:026:023 And if ye will not be reformed by me by these things, but will
           walk contrary unto me;

03:026:024 Then will I also walk contrary unto you, and will punish you
           yet seven times for your sins.

03:026:025 And I will bring a sword upon you, that shall avenge the
           quarrel of my covenant: and when ye are gathered together
           within your cities, I will send the pestilence among you; and
           ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy.

03:026:026 And when I have broken the staff of your bread, ten women
           shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver you
           your bread again by weight: and ye shall eat, and not be
           satisfied.

03:026:027 And if ye will not for all this hearken unto me, but walk
           contrary unto me;

03:026:028 Then I will walk contrary unto you also in fury; and I, even
           I, will chastise you seven times for your sins.

03:026:029 And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your
           daughters shall ye eat.

03:026:030 And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your images,
           and cast your carcases upon the carcases of your idols, and my
           soul shall abhor you.

03:026:031 And I will make your cities waste, and bring your sanctuaries
           unto desolation, and I will not smell the savour of your sweet
           odours.

03:026:032 And I will bring the land into desolation: and your enemies
           which dwell therein shall be astonished at it.

03:026:033 And I will scatter you among the heathen, and will draw out a
           sword after you: and your land shall be desolate, and your
           cities waste.

03:026:034 Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long as it lieth
           desolate, and ye be in your enemies' land; even then shall the
           land rest, and enjoy her sabbaths.

03:026:035 As long as it lieth desolate it shall rest; because it did not
           rest in your sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it.

03:026:036 And upon them that are left alive of you I will send a
           faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies; and
           the sound of a shaken leaf shall chase them; and they shall
           flee, as fleeing from a sword; and they shall fall when none
           pursueth.

03:026:037 And they shall fall one upon another, as it were before a
           sword, when none pursueth: and ye shall have no power to stand
           before your enemies.

03:026:038 And ye shall perish among the heathen, and the land of your
           enemies shall eat you up.

03:026:039 And they that are left of you shall pine away in their
           iniquity in your enemies' lands; and also in the iniquities of
           their fathers shall they pine away with them.

03:026:040 If they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of
           their fathers, with their trespass which they trespassed
           against me, and that also they have walked contrary unto me;

03:026:041 And that I also have walked contrary unto them, and have
           brought them into the land of their enemies; if then their
           uncircumcised hearts be humbled, and they then accept of the
           punishment of their iniquity:

03:026:042 Then will I remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my
           covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I
           remember; and I will remember the land.

03:026:043 The land also shall be left of them, and shall enjoy her
           sabbaths, while she lieth desolate without them: and they
           shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity: because,
           even because they despised my judgments, and because their
           soul abhorred my statutes.

03:026:044 And yet for all that, when they be in the land of their
           enemies, I will not cast them away, neither will I abhor them,
           to destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them:
           for I am the LORD their God.

03:026:045 But I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their
           ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in
           the sight of the heathen, that I might be their God: I am the
           LORD.

03:026:046 These are the statutes and judgments and laws, which the LORD
           made between him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by
           the hand of Moses.

03:027:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

03:027:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When a
           man shall make a singular vow, the persons shall be for the
           LORD by thy estimation.

03:027:003 And thy estimation shall be of the male from twenty years old
           even unto sixty years old, even thy estimation shall be fifty
           shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary.

03:027:004 And if it be a female, then thy estimation shall be thirty
           shekels.

03:027:005 And if it be from five years old even unto twenty years old,
           then thy estimation shall be of the male twenty shekels, and
           for the female ten shekels.

03:027:006 And if it be from a month old even unto five years old, then
           thy estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver,
           and for the female thy estimation shall be three shekels of
           silver.

03:027:007 And if it be from sixty years old and above; if it be a male,
           then thy estimation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the
           female ten shekels.

03:027:008 But if he be poorer than thy estimation, then he shall present
           himself before the priest, and the priest shall value him;
           according to his ability that vowed shall the priest value
           him.

03:027:009 And if it be a beast, whereof men bring an offering unto the
           LORD, all that any man giveth of such unto the LORD shall be
           holy.

03:027:010 He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a
           bad for a good: and if he shall at all change beast for beast,
           then it and the exchange thereof shall be holy.

03:027:011 And if it be any unclean beast, of which they do not offer a
           sacrifice unto the LORD, then he shall present the beast
           before the priest:

03:027:012 And the priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad: as
           thou valuest it, who art the priest, so shall it be.

03:027:013 But if he will at all redeem it, then he shall add a fifth
           part thereof unto thy estimation.

03:027:014 And when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy unto the
           LORD, then the priest shall estimate it, whether it be good or
           bad: as the priest shall estimate it, so shall it stand.

03:027:015 And if he that sanctified it will redeem his house, then he
           shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto
           it, and it shall be his.

03:027:016 And if a man shall sanctify unto the LORD some part of a field
           of his possession, then thy estimation shall be according to
           the seed thereof: an homer of barley seed shall be valued at
           fifty shekels of silver.

03:027:017 If he sanctify his field from the year of jubile, according to
           thy estimation it shall stand.

03:027:018 But if he sanctify his field after the jubile, then the priest
           shall reckon unto him the money according to the years that
           remain, even unto the year of the jubile, and it shall be
           abated from thy estimation.

03:027:019 And if he that sanctified the field will in any wise redeem
           it, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy
           estimation unto it, and it shall be assured to him.

03:027:020 And if he will not redeem the field, or if he have sold the
           field to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more.

03:027:021 But the field, when it goeth out in the jubile, shall be holy
           unto the LORD, as a field devoted; the possession thereof
           shall be the priest's.

03:027:022 And if a man sanctify unto the LORD a field which he hath
           bought, which is not of the fields of his possession;

03:027:023 Then the priest shall reckon unto him the worth of thy
           estimation, even unto the year of the jubile: and he shall
           give thine estimation in that day, as a holy thing unto the
           LORD.

03:027:024 In the year of the jubile the field shall return unto him of
           whom it was bought, even to him to whom the possession of the
           land did belong.

03:027:025 And all thy estimations shall be according to the shekel of
           the sanctuary: twenty gerahs shall be the shekel.

03:027:026 Only the firstling of the beasts, which should be the LORD's
           firstling, no man shall sanctify it; whether it be ox, or
           sheep: it is the LORD's.

03:027:027 And if it be of an unclean beast, then he shall redeem it
           according to thine estimation, and shall add a fifth part of
           it thereto: or if it be not redeemed, then it shall be sold
           according to thy estimation.

03:027:028 Notwithstanding no devoted thing, that a man shall devote unto
           the LORD of all that he hath, both of man and beast, and of
           the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed: every
           devoted thing is most holy unto the LORD.

03:027:029 None devoted, which shall be devoted of men, shall be
           redeemed; but shall surely be put to death.

03:027:030 And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the
           land, or of the fruit of the tree, is the LORD's: it is holy
           unto the LORD.

03:027:031 And if a man will at all redeem ought of his tithes, he shall
           add thereto the fifth part thereof.

03:027:032 And concerning the tithe of the herd, or of the flock, even of
           whatsoever passeth under the rod, the tenth shall be holy unto
           the LORD.

03:027:033 He shall not search whether it be good or bad, neither shall
           he change it: and if he change it at all, then both it and the
           change thereof shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed.

03:027:034 These are the commandments, which the LORD commanded Moses for
           the children of Israel in mount Sinai.

Book 04        Numbers

04:001:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in
           the tabernacle of the congregation, on the first day of the
           second month, in the second year after they were come out of
           the land of Egypt, saying,

04:001:003 From twenty years old and upward, all that are able to go
           forth to war in Israel: thou and Aaron shall number them by
           their armies.

04:001:004 And with you there shall be a man of every tribe; every one
           head of the house of his fathers.

04:001:017 And Moses and Aaron took these men which are expressed by
           their names:

04:001:018 And they assembled all the congregation together on the first
           day of the second month, and they declared their pedigrees
           after their families, by the house of their fathers, according
           to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward,
           by their polls.

04:001:019 As the LORD commanded Moses, so he numbered them in the
           wilderness of Sinai.

04:001:020 And the children of Reuben, Israel's eldest son, by their
           generations, after their families, by the house of their
           fathers, according to the number of the names, by their polls,
           every male from twenty years old and upward, all that were

           that were able to go forth to war;

04:001:039 Those that were numbered of them, even of the tribe of Dan,
           were threescore and two thousand and seven hundred.

04:001:040 Of the children of Asher, by their generations, after their

04:001:042 Of the children of Naphtali, throughout their generations,
           after their families, by the house of their fathers, according

           Naphtali, were fifty and three thousand and four hundred.

04:001:044 These are those that were numbered, which Moses and Aaron
           numbered, and the princes of Israel, being twelve men: each
           one was for the house of his fathers.

04:001:045 So were all those that were numbered of the children of
           Israel, by the house of their fathers, from twenty years old
           and upward, all that were able to go forth to war in Israel;

04:001:046 Even all they that were numbered were six hundred thousand and
           three thousand and five hundred and fifty.

04:001:047 But the Levites after the tribe of their fathers were not
           numbered among them.

04:001:048 For the LORD had spoken unto Moses, saying,

04:001:049 Only thou shalt not number the tribe of Levi, neither take the
           sum of them among the children of Israel:

04:001:050 But thou shalt appoint the Levites over the tabernacle of
           testimony, and over all the vessels thereof, and over all
           things that belong to it: they shall bear the tabernacle, and
           all the vessels thereof; and they shall minister unto it, and
           shall encamp round about the tabernacle.

04:001:051 And when the tabernacle setteth forward, the Levites shall
           take it down: and when the tabernacle is to be pitched, the
           Levites shall set it up: and the stranger that cometh nigh
           shall be put to death.

04:001:052 And the children of Israel shall pitch their tents, every man
           by his own camp, and every man by his own standard, throughout
           their hosts.

04:001:053 But the Levites shall pitch round about the tabernacle of
           testimony, that there be no wrath upon the congregation of the
           children of Israel: and the Levites shall keep the charge of
           the tabernacle of testimony.

04:001:054 And the children of Israel did according to all that the LORD
           commanded Moses, so did they.

04:002:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,

04:002:002 Every man of the children of Israel shall pitch by his own
           standard, with the ensign of their father's house: far off
           about the tabernacle of the congregation shall they pitch.

04:002:003 And on the east side toward the rising of the sun shall they
           of the standard of the camp of Judah pitch throughout their
           armies: and Nahshon the son of Amminadab shall be captain of
           the children of Judah.

04:002:004 And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were
           threescore and fourteen thousand and six hundred.

04:002:005 And those that do pitch next unto him shall be the tribe of
           Issachar: and Nethaneel the son of Zuar shall be captain of
           the children of Issachar.

04:002:006 And his host, and those that were numbered thereof, were fifty
           and four thousand and four hundred.

04:002:007 Then the tribe of Zebulun: and Eliab the son of Helon shall be
           captain of the children of Zebulun.

04:002:008 And his host, and those that were numbered thereof, were fifty
           and seven thousand and four hundred.

04:002:009 All that were numbered in the camp of Judah were an hundred
           thousand and fourscore thousand and six thousand and four
           hundred, throughout their armies. These shall first set forth.

04:002:010 On the south side shall be the standard of the camp of Reuben
           according to their armies: and the captain of the children of
           Reuben shall be Elizur the son of Shedeur.

04:002:011 And his host, and those that were numbered thereof, were forty
           and six thousand and five hundred.

04:002:012 And those which pitch by him shall be the tribe of Simeon: and
           the captain of the children of Simeon shall be Shelumiel the
           son of Zurishaddai.

04:002:013 And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were fifty
           and nine thousand and three hundred.

04:002:014 Then the tribe of Gad: and the captain of the sons of Gad
           shall be Eliasaph the son of Reuel.

04:002:015 And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were forty
           and five thousand and six hundred and fifty.

04:002:016 All that were numbered in the camp of Reuben were an hundred
           thousand and fifty and one thousand and four hundred and
           fifty, throughout their armies. And they shall set forth in
           the second rank.

04:002:017 Then the tabernacle of the congregation shall set forward with
           the camp of the Levites in the midst of the camp: as they
           encamp, so shall they set forward, every man in his place by
           their standards.

04:002:018 On the west side shall be the standard of the camp of Ephraim
           according to their armies: and the captain of the sons of
           Ephraim shall be Elishama the son of Ammihud.

04:002:019 And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were forty
           thousand and five hundred.

04:002:020 And by him shall be the tribe of Manasseh: and the captain of
           the children of Manasseh shall be Gamaliel the son of
           Pedahzur.

04:002:021 And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were
           thirty and two thousand and two hundred.

04:002:022 Then the tribe of Benjamin: and the captain of the sons of
           Benjamin shall be Abidan the son of Gideoni.

04:002:023 And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were
           thirty and five thousand and four hundred.

04:002:024 All that were numbered of the camp of Ephraim were an hundred
           thousand and eight thousand and an hundred, throughout their
           armies. And they shall go forward in the third rank.

04:002:025 The standard of the camp of Dan shall be on the north side by
           their armies: and the captain of the children of Dan shall be
           Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai.

04:002:026 And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were
           threescore and two thousand and seven hundred.

04:002:027 And those that encamp by him shall be the tribe of Asher: and
           the captain of the children of Asher shall be Pagiel the son
           of Ocran.

04:002:028 And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were forty
           and one thousand and five hundred.

04:002:029 Then the tribe of Naphtali: and the captain of the children of
           Naphtali shall be Ahira the son of Enan.

04:002:030 And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were fifty
           and three thousand and four hundred.

04:002:031 All they that were numbered in the camp of Dan were an hundred
           thousand and fifty and seven thousand and six hundred. They
           shall go hindmost with their standards.

04:002:032 These are those which were numbered of the children of Israel
           by the house of their fathers: all those that were numbered of
           the camps throughout their hosts were six hundred thousand and
           three thousand and five hundred and fifty.

04:002:033 But the Levites were not numbered among the children of
           Israel; as the LORD commanded Moses.

04:002:034 And the children of Israel did according to all that the LORD
           commanded Moses: so they pitched by their standards, and so
           they set forward, every one after their families, according to
           the house of their fathers.

04:003:001 These also are the generations of Aaron and Moses in the day
           that the LORD spake with Moses in mount Sinai.

04:003:002 And these are the names of the sons of Aaron; Nadab the
           firstborn, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.

04:003:003 These are the names of the sons of Aaron, the priests which
           were anointed, whom he consecrated to minister in the priest's
           office.

04:003:004 And Nadab and Abihu died before the LORD, when they offered
           strange fire before the LORD, in the wilderness of Sinai, and
           they had no children: and Eleazar and Ithamar ministered in
           the priest's office in the sight of Aaron their father.

04:003:005 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

04:003:006 Bring the tribe of Levi near, and present them before Aaron
           the priest, that they may minister unto him.

04:003:007 And they shall keep his charge, and the charge of the whole
           congregation before the tabernacle of the congregation, to do
           the service of the tabernacle.

04:003:008 And they shall keep all the instruments of the tabernacle of
           the congregation, and the charge of the children of Israel, to
           do the service of the tabernacle.

04:003:009 And thou shalt give the Levites unto Aaron and to his sons:
           they are wholly given unto him out of the children of Israel.

04:003:010 And thou shalt appoint Aaron and his sons, and they shall wait
           on their priest's office: and the stranger that cometh nigh
           shall be put to death.

04:003:011 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

04:003:012 And I, behold, I have taken the Levites from among the
           children of Israel instead of all the firstborn that openeth
           the matrix among the children of Israel: therefore the Levites
           shall be mine;

04:003:013 Because all the firstborn are mine; for on the day that I
           smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt I hallowed unto
           me all the firstborn in Israel, both man and beast: mine shall
           they be: I am the LORD.

04:003:014 And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai,
           saying,

04:003:015 Number the children of Levi after the house of their fathers,
           by their families: every male from a month old and upward
           shalt thou number them.

04:003:016 And Moses numbered them according to the word of the LORD, as
           he was commanded.

04:003:017 And these were the sons of Levi by their names; Gershon, and
           Kohath, and Merari.

04:003:018 And these are the names of the sons of Gershon by their
           families; Libni, and Shimei.

04:003:019 And the sons of Kohath by their families; Amram, and Izehar,
           Hebron, and Uzziel.

04:003:020 And the sons of Merari by their families; Mahli, and Mushi.
           These are the families of the Levites according to the house
           of their fathers.

04:003:021 Of Gershon was the family of the Libnites, and the family of
           the Shimites: these are the families of the Gershonites.

04:003:022 Those that were numbered of them, according to the number of
           all the males, from a month old and upward, even those that
           were numbered of them were seven thousand and five hundred.

04:003:023 The families of the Gershonites shall pitch behind the
           tabernacle westward.

04:003:024 And the chief of the house of the father of the Gershonites
           shall be Eliasaph the son of Lael.

04:003:025 And the charge of the sons of Gershon in the tabernacle of the
           congregation shall be the tabernacle, and the tent, the
           covering thereof, and the hanging for the door of the
           tabernacle of the congregation,

04:003:026 And the hangings of the court, and the curtain for the door of
           the court, which is by the tabernacle, and by the altar round
           about, and the cords of it for all the service thereof.

04:003:027 And of Kohath was the family of the Amramites, and the family
           of the Izeharites, and the family of the Hebronites, and the
           family of the Uzzielites: these are the families of the
           Kohathites.

04:003:028 In the number of all the males, from a month old and upward,
           were eight thousand and six hundred, keeping the charge of the
           sanctuary.

04:003:029 The families of the sons of Kohath shall pitch on the side of
           the tabernacle southward.

04:003:030 And the chief of the house of the father of the families of
           the Kohathites shall be Elizaphan the son of Uzziel.

04:003:031 And their charge shall be the ark, and the table, and the
           candlestick, and the altars, and the vessels of the sanctuary
           wherewith they minister, and the hanging, and all the service
           thereof.

04:003:032 And Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest shall be chief over
           the chief of the Levites, and have the oversight of them that
           keep the charge of the sanctuary.

04:003:033 Of Merari was the family of the Mahlites, and the family of
           the Mushites: these are the families of Merari.

04:003:034 And those that were numbered of them, according to the number
           of all the males, from a month old and upward, were six
           thousand and two hundred.

04:003:035 And the chief of the house of the father of the families of
           Merari was Zuriel the son of Abihail: these shall pitch on the
           side of the tabernacle northward.

04:003:036 And under the custody and charge of the sons of Merari shall
           be the boards of the tabernacle, and the bars thereof, and the
           pillars thereof, and the sockets thereof, and all the vessels
           thereof, and all that serveth thereto,

04:003:037 And the pillars of the court round about, and their sockets,
           and their pins, and their cords.

04:003:038 But those that encamp before the tabernacle toward the east,
           even before the tabernacle of the congregation eastward, shall
           be Moses, and Aaron and his sons, keeping the charge of the
           sanctuary for the charge of the children of Israel; and the
           stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death.

04:003:039 All that were numbered of the Levites, which Moses and Aaron
           numbered at the commandment of the LORD, throughout their
           families, all the males from a month old and upward, were
           twenty and two thousand.

04:003:040 And the LORD said unto Moses, Number all the firstborn of the
           males of the children of Israel from a month old and upward,
           and take the number of their names.

04:003:041 And thou shalt take the Levites for me (I am the LORD) instead
           of all the firstborn among the children of Israel; and the
           cattle of the Levites instead of all the firstlings among the
           cattle of the children of Israel.

04:003:042 And Moses numbered, as the LORD commanded him, all the
           firstborn among the children of Israel.

04:003:043 And all the firstborn males by the number of names, from a
           month old and upward, of those that were numbered of them,
           were twenty and two thousand two hundred and threescore and
           thirteen.

04:003:044 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

04:003:045 Take the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the
           children of Israel, and the cattle of the Levites instead of
           their cattle; and the Levites shall be mine: I am the LORD.

04:003:046 And for those that are to be redeemed of the two hundred and
           threescore and thirteen of the firstborn of the children of
           Israel, which are more than the Levites;

04:003:047 Thou shalt even take five shekels apiece by the poll, after
           the shekel of the sanctuary shalt thou take them: (the shekel
           is twenty gerahs:)

04:003:048 And thou shalt give the money, wherewith the odd number of
           them is to be redeemed, unto Aaron and to his sons.

04:003:049 And Moses took the redemption money of them that were over and
           above them that were redeemed by the Levites:

04:003:050 Of the firstborn of the children of Israel took he the money;
           a thousand three hundred and threescore and five shekels,
           after the shekel of the sanctuary:

04:003:051 And Moses gave the money of them that were redeemed unto Aaron
           and to his sons, according to the word of the LORD, as the
           LORD commanded Moses.

04:004:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,

04:004:002 Take the sum of the sons of Kohath from among the sons of
           Levi, after their families, by the house of their fathers,

04:004:003 From thirty years old and upward even until fifty years old,
           all that enter into the host, to do the work in the tabernacle
           of the congregation.

04:004:004 This shall be the service of the sons of Kohath in the
           tabernacle of the congregation, about the most holy things:

04:004:005 And when the camp setteth forward, Aaron shall come, and his
           sons, and they shall take down the covering vail, and cover
           the ark of testimony with it:

04:004:006 And shall put thereon the covering of badgers' skins, and
           shall spread over it a cloth wholly of blue, and shall put in
           the staves thereof.

04:004:007 And upon the table of shewbread they shall spread a cloth of
           blue, and put thereon the dishes, and the spoons, and the
           bowls, and covers to cover withal: and the continual bread
           shall be thereon:

04:004:008 And they shall spread upon them a cloth of scarlet, and cover
           the same with a covering of badgers' skins, and shall put in
           the staves thereof.

04:004:009 And they shall take a cloth of blue, and cover the candlestick
           of the light, and his lamps, and his tongs, and his
           snuffdishes, and all the oil vessels thereof, wherewith they
           minister unto it:

04:004:010 And they shall put it and all the vessels thereof within a
           covering of badgers' skins, and shall put it upon a bar.

04:004:011 And upon the golden altar they shall spread a cloth of blue,
           and cover it with a covering of badgers' skins, and shall put
           to the staves thereof:

04:004:012 And they shall take all the instruments of ministry, wherewith
           they minister in the sanctuary, and put them in a cloth of
           blue, and cover them with a covering of badgers' skins, and
           shall put them on a bar:

04:004:013 And they shall take away the ashes from the altar, and spread
           a purple cloth thereon:

04:004:014 And they shall put upon it all the vessels thereof, wherewith
           they minister about it, even the censers, the fleshhooks, and
           the shovels, and the basons, all the vessels of the altar; and
           they shall spread upon it a covering of badgers' skins, and
           put to the staves of it.

04:004:015 And when Aaron and his sons have made an end of covering the
           sanctuary, and all the vessels of the sanctuary, as the camp
           is to set forward; after that, the sons of Kohath shall come
           to bear it: but they shall not touch any holy thing, lest they
           die. These things are the burden of the sons of Kohath in the
           tabernacle of the congregation.

04:004:016 And to the office of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest
           pertaineth the oil for the light, and the sweet incense, and
           the daily meat offering, and the anointing oil, and the
           oversight of all the tabernacle, and of all that therein is,
           in the sanctuary, and in the vessels thereof.

04:004:017 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron saying,

04:004:018 Cut ye not off the tribe of the families of the Kohathites
           from among the Levites:

04:004:019 But thus do unto them, that they may live, and not die, when
           they approach unto the most holy things: Aaron and his sons
           shall go in, and appoint them every one to his service and to
           his burden:

04:004:020 But they shall not go in to see when the holy things are
           covered, lest they die.

04:004:021 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

04:004:022 Take also the sum of the sons of Gershon, throughout the
           houses of their fathers, by their families;

04:004:023 From thirty years old and upward until fifty years old shalt
           thou number them; all that enter in to perform the service, to
           do the work in the tabernacle of the congregation.

04:004:024 This is the service of the families of the Gershonites, to
           serve, and for burdens:

04:004:025 And they shall bear the curtains of the tabernacle, and the
           tabernacle of the congregation, his covering, and the covering
           of the badgers' skins that is above upon it, and the hanging
           for the door of the tabernacle of the congregation,

04:004:026 And the hangings of the court, and the hanging for the door of
           the gate of the court, which is by the tabernacle and by the
           altar round about, and their cords, and all the instruments of
           their service, and all that is made for them: so shall they
           serve.

04:004:027 At the appointment of Aaron and his sons shall be all the
           service of the sons of the Gershonites, in all their burdens,
           and in all their service: and ye shall appoint unto them in
           charge all their burdens.

04:004:028 This is the service of the families of the sons of Gershon in
           the tabernacle of the congregation: and their charge shall be
           under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.

04:004:029 As for the sons of Merari, thou shalt number them after their
           families, by the house of their fathers;

04:004:030 From thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old
           shalt thou number them, every one that entereth into the
           service, to do the work of the tabernacle of the congregation.

04:004:031 And this is the charge of their burden, according to all their
           service in the tabernacle of the congregation; the boards of
           the tabernacle, and the bars thereof, and the pillars thereof,
           and sockets thereof,

04:004:032 And the pillars of the court round about, and their sockets,
           and their pins, and their cords, with all their instruments,
           and with all their service: and by name ye shall reckon the
           instruments of the charge of their burden.

04:004:033 This is the service of the families of the sons of Merari,
           according to all their service, in the tabernacle of the
           congregation, under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the
           priest.

04:004:034 And Moses and Aaron and the chief of the congregation numbered
           the sons of the Kohathites after their families, and after the
           house of their fathers,

04:004:035 From thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old,
           every one that entereth into the service, for the work in the
           tabernacle of the congregation:

04:004:036 And those that were numbered of them by their families were
           two thousand seven hundred and fifty.

04:004:037 These were they that were numbered of the families of the
           Kohathites, all that might do service in the tabernacle of the
           congregation, which Moses and Aaron did number according to
           the commandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses.

04:004:038 And those that were numbered of the sons of Gershon,
           throughout their families, and by the house of their fathers,

04:004:039 From thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old,
           every one that entereth into the service, for the work in the
           tabernacle of the congregation,

04:004:040 Even those that were numbered of them, throughout their
           families, by the house of their fathers, were two thousand and
           six hundred and thirty.

04:004:041 These are they that were numbered of the families of the sons
           of Gershon, of all that might do service in the tabernacle of
           the congregation, whom Moses and Aaron did number according to
           the commandment of the LORD.

04:004:042 And those that were numbered of the families of the sons of
           Merari, throughout their families, by the house of their
           fathers,

04:004:043 From thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old,
           every one that entereth into the service, for the work in the
           tabernacle of the congregation,

04:004:044 Even those that were numbered of them after their families,
           were three thousand and two hundred.

04:004:045 These be those that were numbered of the families of the sons
           of Merari, whom Moses and Aaron numbered according to the word
           of the LORD by the hand of Moses.

04:004:046 All those that were numbered of the Levites, whom Moses and
           Aaron and the chief of Israel numbered, after their families,
           and after the house of their fathers,

04:004:047 From thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old,
           every one that came to do the service of the ministry, and the
           service of the burden in the tabernacle of the congregation.

04:004:048 Even those that were numbered of them, were eight thousand and
           five hundred and fourscore,

04:004:049 According to the commandment of the LORD they were numbered by
           the hand of Moses, every one according to his service, and
           according to his burden: thus were they numbered of him, as
           the LORD commanded Moses.

04:005:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

04:005:002 Command the children of Israel, that they put out of the camp
           every leper, and every one that hath an issue, and whosoever
           is defiled by the dead:

04:005:003 Both male and female shall ye put out, without the camp shall
           ye put them; that they defile not their camps, in the midst
           whereof I dwell.

04:005:004 And the children of Israel did so, and put them out without
           the camp: as the LORD spake unto Moses, so did the children of
           Israel.

04:005:005 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

04:005:006 Speak unto the children of Israel, When a man or woman shall
           commit any sin that men commit, to do a trespass against the
           LORD, and that person be guilty;

04:005:007 Then they shall confess their sin which they have done: and he
           shall recompense his trespass with the principal thereof, and
           add unto it the fifth part thereof, and give it unto him
           against whom he hath trespassed.

04:005:008 But if the man have no kinsman to recompense the trespass
           unto, let the trespass be recompensed unto the LORD, even to
           the priest; beside the ram of the atonement, whereby an
           atonement shall be made for him.

04:005:009 And every offering of all the holy things of the children of
           Israel, which they bring unto the priest, shall be his.

04:005:010 And every man's hallowed things shall be his: whatsoever any
           man giveth the priest, it shall be his.

04:005:011 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

04:005:012 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If any
           man's wife go aside, and commit a trespass against him,

04:005:013 And a man lie with her carnally, and it be hid from the eyes
           of her husband, and be kept close, and she be defiled, and
           there be no witness against her, neither she be taken with the
           manner;

04:005:014 And the spirit of jealousy come upon him, and he be jealous of
           his wife, and she be defiled: or if the spirit of jealousy
           come upon him, and he be jealous of his wife, and she be not
           defiled:

04:005:015 Then shall the man bring his wife unto the priest, and he
           shall bring her offering for her, the tenth part of an ephah
           of barley meal; he shall pour no oil upon it, nor put
           frankincense thereon; for it is an offering of jealousy, an
           offering of memorial, bringing iniquity to remembrance.

04:005:016 And the priest shall bring her near, and set her before the
           LORD:

04:005:017 And the priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel; and
           of the dust that is in the floor of the tabernacle the priest
           shall take, and put it into the water:

04:005:018 And the priest shall set the woman before the LORD, and
           uncover the woman's head, and put the offering of memorial in
           her hands, which is the jealousy offering: and the priest
           shall have in his hand the bitter water that causeth the
           curse:

04:005:019 And the priest shall charge her by an oath, and say unto the
           woman, If no man have lain with thee, and if thou hast not
           gone aside to uncleanness with another instead of thy husband,
           be thou free from this bitter water that causeth the curse:

04:005:020 But if thou hast gone aside to another instead of thy husband,
           and if thou be defiled, and some man have lain with thee
           beside thine husband:

04:005:021 Then the priest shall charge the woman with an oath of
           cursing, and the priest shall say unto the woman, The LORD
           make thee a curse and an oath among thy people, when the LORD
           doth make thy thigh to rot, and thy belly to swell;

04:005:022 And this water that causeth the curse shall go into thy
           bowels, to make thy belly to swell, and thy thigh to rot: And
           the woman shall say, Amen, amen.

04:005:023 And the priest shall write these curses in a book, and he
           shall blot them out with the bitter water:

04:005:024 And he shall cause the woman to drink the bitter water that
           causeth the curse: and the water that causeth the curse shall
           enter into her, and become bitter.

04:005:025 Then the priest shall take the jealousy offering out of the
           woman's hand, and shall wave the offering before the LORD, and
           offer it upon the altar:

04:005:026 And the priest shall take an handful of the offering, even the
           memorial thereof, and burn it upon the altar, and afterward
           shall cause the woman to drink the water.

04:005:027 And when he hath made her to drink the water, then it shall
           come to pass, that, if she be defiled, and have done trespass
           against her husband, that the water that causeth the curse
           shall enter into her, and become bitter, and her belly shall
           swell, and her thigh shall rot: and the woman shall be a curse
           among her people.

04:005:028 And if the woman be not defiled, but be clean; then she shall
           be free, and shall conceive seed.

04:005:029 This is the law of jealousies, when a wife goeth aside to
           another instead of her husband, and is defiled;

04:005:030 Or when the spirit of jealousy cometh upon him, and he be
           jealous over his wife, and shall set the woman before the
           LORD, and the priest shall execute upon her all this law.

04:005:031 Then shall the man be guiltless from iniquity, and this woman
           shall bear her iniquity.

04:006:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

04:006:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When
           either man or woman shall separate themselves to vow a vow of
           a Nazarite, to separate themselves unto the LORD:

04:006:003 He shall separate himself from wine and strong drink, and
           shall drink no vinegar of wine, or vinegar of strong drink,
           neither shall he drink any liquor of grapes, nor eat moist
           grapes, or dried.

04:006:004 All the days of his separation shall he eat nothing that is
           made of the vine tree, from the kernels even to the husk.

04:006:005 All the days of the vow of his separation there shall no razor
           come upon his head: until the days be fulfilled, in the which
           he separateth himself unto the LORD, he shall be holy, and
           shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow.

04:006:006 All the days that he separateth himself unto the LORD he shall
           come at no dead body.

04:006:007 He shall not make himself unclean for his father, or for his
           mother, for his brother, or for his sister, when they die:
           because the consecration of his God is upon his head.

04:006:008 All the days of his separation he is holy unto the LORD.

04:006:009 And if any man die very suddenly by him, and he hath defiled
           the head of his consecration; then he shall shave his head in
           the day of his cleansing, on the seventh day shall he shave
           it.

04:006:010 And on the eighth day he shall bring two turtles, or two young
           pigeons, to the priest, to the door of the tabernacle of the
           congregation:

04:006:011 And the priest shall offer the one for a sin offering, and the
           other for a burnt offering, and make an atonement for him, for
           that he sinned by the dead, and shall hallow his head that
           same day.

04:006:012 And he shall consecrate unto the LORD the days of his
           separation, and shall bring a lamb of the first year for a
           trespass offering: but the days that were before shall be
           lost, because his separation was defiled.

04:006:013 And this is the law of the Nazarite, when the days of his
           separation are fulfilled: he shall be brought unto the door of
           the tabernacle of the congregation:

04:006:014 And he shall offer his offering unto the LORD, one he lamb of
           the first year without blemish for a burnt offering, and one
           ewe lamb of the first year without blemish for a sin offering,
           and one ram without blemish for peace offerings,

04:006:015 And a basket of unleavened bread, cakes of fine flour mingled
           with oil, and wafers of unleavened bread anointed with oil,
           and their meat offering, and their drink offerings.

04:006:016 And the priest shall bring them before the LORD, and shall
           offer his sin offering, and his burnt offering:

04:006:017 And he shall offer the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings
           unto the LORD, with the basket of unleavened bread: the priest
           shall offer also his meat offering, and his drink offering.

04:006:018 And the Nazarite shall shave the head of his separation at the
           door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall take the
           hair of the head of his separation, and put it in the fire
           which is under the sacrifice of the peace offerings.

04:006:019 And the priest shall take the sodden shoulder of the ram, and
           one unleavened cake out of the basket, and one unleavened
           wafer, and shall put them upon the hands of the Nazarite,
           after the hair of his separation is shaven:

04:006:020 And the priest shall wave them for a wave offering before the
           LORD: this is holy for the priest, with the wave breast and
           heave shoulder: and after that the Nazarite may drink wine.

04:006:021 This is the law of the Nazarite who hath vowed, and of his
           offering unto the LORD for his separation, beside that that
           his hand shall get: according to the vow which he vowed, so he
           must do after the law of his separation.

04:006:022 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

04:006:023 Speak unto Aaron and unto his sons, saying, On this wise ye
           shall bless the children of Israel, saying unto them,

04:006:024 The LORD bless thee, and keep thee:

04:006:025 The LORD make his face shine upon thee, and be gracious unto
           thee:

04:006:026 The LORD lift up his countenance upon thee, and give thee
           peace.

04:006:027 And they shall put my name upon the children of Israel, and I
           will bless them.

04:007:001 And it came to pass on the day that Moses had fully set up the
           tabernacle, and had anointed it, and sanctified it, and all
           the instruments thereof, both the altar and all the vessels
           thereof, and had anointed them, and sanctified them;

04:007:002 That the princes of Israel, heads of the house of their
           fathers, who were the princes of the tribes, and were over
           them that were numbered, offered:

04:007:003 And they brought their offering before the LORD, six covered
           wagons, and twelve oxen; a wagon for two of the princes, and
           for each one an ox: and they brought them before the
           tabernacle.

04:007:004 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

04:007:005 Take it of them, that they may be to do the service of the
           tabernacle of the congregation; and thou shalt give them unto
           the Levites, to every man according to his service.

04:007:006 And Moses took the wagons and the oxen, and gave them unto the
           Levites.

04:007:007 Two wagons and four oxen he gave unto the sons of Gershon,
           according to their service:

04:007:008 And four wagons and eight oxen he gave unto the sons of
           Merari, according unto their service, under the hand of
           Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.

04:007:009 But unto the sons of Kohath he gave none: because the service
           of the sanctuary belonging unto them was that they should bear
           upon their shoulders.

04:007:010 And the princes offered for dedicating of the altar in the day
           that it was anointed, even the princes offered their offering
           before the altar.

04:007:011 And the LORD said unto Moses, They shall offer their offering,
           each prince on his day, for the dedicating of the altar.

04:007:012 And he that offered his offering the first day was Nahshon the
           son of Amminadab, of the tribe of Judah:

           was an hundred and thirty shekels, one silver bowl of seventy

           speaking unto him from off the mercy seat that was upon the
           ark of testimony, from between the two cherubims: and he spake
           unto him.

04:008:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

04:008:002 Speak unto Aaron and say unto him, When thou lightest the
           lamps, the seven lamps shall give light over against the
           candlestick.

04:008:003 And Aaron did so; he lighted the lamps thereof over against
           the candlestick, as the LORD commanded Moses.

04:008:004 And this work of the candlestick was of beaten gold, unto the
           shaft thereof, unto the flowers thereof, was beaten work:
           according unto the pattern which the LORD had shewed Moses, so
           he made the candlestick.

04:008:005 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

04:008:006 Take the Levites from among the children of Israel, and
           cleanse them.

04:008:007 And thus shalt thou do unto them, to cleanse them: Sprinkle
           water of purifying upon them, and let them shave all their
           flesh, and let them wash their clothes, and so make themselves
           clean.

04:008:008 Then let them take a young bullock with his meat offering,
           even fine flour mingled with oil, and another young bullock
           shalt thou take for a sin offering.

04:008:009 And thou shalt bring the Levites before the tabernacle of the
           congregation: and thou shalt gather the whole assembly of the
           children of Israel together:

04:008:010 And thou shalt bring the Levites before the LORD: and the
           children of Israel shall put their hands upon the Levites:

04:008:011 And Aaron shall offer the Levites before the LORD for an
           offering of the children of Israel, that they may execute the
           service of the LORD.

04:008:012 And the Levites shall lay their hands upon the heads of the
           bullocks: and thou shalt offer the one for a sin offering, and
           the other for a burnt offering, unto the LORD, to make an
           atonement for the Levites.

04:008:013 And thou shalt set the Levites before Aaron, and before his
           sons, and offer them for an offering unto the LORD.

04:008:014 Thus shalt thou separate the Levites from among the children
           of Israel: and the Levites shall be mine.

04:008:015 And after that shall the Levites go in to do the service of
           the tabernacle of the congregation: and thou shalt cleanse
           them, and offer them for an offering.

04:008:016 For they are wholly given unto me from among the children of
           Israel; instead of such as open every womb, even instead of
           the firstborn of all the children of Israel, have I taken them
           unto me.

04:008:017 For all the firstborn of the children of Israel are mine, both
           man and beast: on the day that I smote every firstborn in the
           land of Egypt I sanctified them for myself.

04:008:018 And I have taken the Levites for all the firstborn of the
           children of Israel.

04:008:019 And I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and to his
           sons from among the children of Israel, to do the service of
           the children of Israel in the tabernacle of the congregation,
           and to make an atonement for the children of Israel: that
           there be no plague among the children of Israel, when the
           children of Israel come nigh unto the sanctuary.

04:008:020 And Moses, and Aaron, and all the congregation of the children
           of Israel, did to the Levites according unto all that the LORD
           commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so did the children of
           Israel unto them.

04:008:021 And the Levites were purified, and they washed their clothes;
           and Aaron offered them as an offering before the LORD; and
           Aaron made an atonement for them to cleanse them.

04:008:022 And after that went the Levites in to do their service in the
           tabernacle of the congregation before Aaron, and before his
           sons: as the LORD had commanded Moses concerning the Levites,
           so did they unto them.

04:008:023 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

04:008:024 This is it that belongeth unto the Levites: from twenty and
           five years old and upward they shall go in to wait upon the
           service of the tabernacle of the congregation:

04:008:025 And from the age of fifty years they shall cease waiting upon
           the service thereof, and shall serve no more:

04:008:026 But shall minister with their brethren in the tabernacle of
           the congregation, to keep the charge, and shall do no service.
           Thus shalt thou do unto the Levites touching their charge.

04:009:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in
           the first month of the second year after they were come out of
           the land of Egypt, saying,

04:009:002 Let the children of Israel also keep the passover at his
           appointed season.

04:009:003 In the fourteenth day of this month, at even, ye shall keep it
           in his appointed season: according to all the rites of it, and
           according to all the ceremonies thereof, shall ye keep it.

04:009:004 And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, that they should
           keep the passover.

04:009:005 And they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the first
           month at even in the wilderness of Sinai: according to all
           that the LORD commanded Moses, so did the children of Israel.

04:009:006 And there were certain men, who were defiled by the dead body
           of a man, that they could not keep the passover on that day:
           and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day:

04:009:007 And those men said unto him, We are defiled by the dead body
           of a man: wherefore are we kept back, that we may not offer an
           offering of the LORD in his appointed season among the
           children of Israel?

04:009:008 And Moses said unto them, Stand still, and I will hear what
           the LORD will command concerning you.

04:009:009 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

04:009:010 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If any man of you
           or of your posterity shall be unclean by reason of a dead
           body, or be in a journey afar off, yet he shall keep the
           passover unto the LORD.

04:009:011 The fourteenth day of the second month at even they shall keep
           it, and eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.

04:009:012 They shall leave none of it unto the morning, nor break any
           bone of it: according to all the ordinances of the passover
           they shall keep it.

04:009:013 But the man that is clean, and is not in a journey, and
           forbeareth to keep the passover, even the same soul shall be
           cut off from among his people: because he brought not the
           offering of the LORD in his appointed season, that man shall
           bear his sin.

04:009:014 And if a stranger shall sojourn among you, and will keep the
           passover unto the LORD; according to the ordinance of the
           passover, and according to the manner thereof, so shall he do:
           ye shall have one ordinance, both for the stranger, and for
           him that was born in the land.

04:009:015 And on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud
           covered the tabernacle, namely, the tent of the testimony: and
           at even there was upon the tabernacle as it were the
           appearance of fire, until the morning.

04:009:016 So it was alway: the cloud covered it by day, and the
           appearance of fire by night.

04:009:017 And when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle, then
           after that the children of Israel journeyed: and in the place
           where the cloud abode, there the children of Israel pitched
           their tents.

04:009:018 At the commandment of the LORD the children of Israel
           journeyed, and at the commandment of the LORD they pitched: as
           long as the cloud abode upon the tabernacle they rested in
           their tents.

04:009:019 And when the cloud tarried long upon the tabernacle many days,
           then the children of Israel kept the charge of the LORD, and
           journeyed not.

04:009:020 And so it was, when the cloud was a few days upon the
           tabernacle; according to the commandment of the LORD they
           abode in their tents, and according to the commandment of the
           LORD they journeyed.

04:009:021 And so it was, when the cloud abode from even unto the
           morning, and that the cloud was taken up in the morning, then
           they journeyed: whether it was by day or by night that the
           cloud was taken up, they journeyed.

04:009:022 Or whether it were two days, or a month, or a year, that the
           cloud tarried upon the tabernacle, remaining thereon, the
           children of Israel abode in their tents, and journeyed not:
           but when it was taken up, they journeyed.

04:009:023 At the commandment of the LORD they rested in the tents, and
           at the commandment of the LORD they journeyed: they kept the
           charge of the LORD, at the commandment of the LORD by the hand
           of Moses.

04:010:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

04:010:002 Make thee two trumpets of silver; of a whole piece shalt thou
           make them: that thou mayest use them for the calling of the
           assembly, and for the journeying of the camps.

04:010:003 And when they shall blow with them, all the assembly shall
           assemble themselves to thee at the door of the tabernacle of
           the congregation.

04:010:004 And if they blow but with one trumpet, then the princes, which
           are heads of the thousands of Israel, shall gather themselves
           unto thee.

04:010:005 When ye blow an alarm, then the camps that lie on the east
           parts shall go forward.

04:010:006 When ye blow an alarm the second time, then the camps that lie
           on the south side shall take their journey: they shall blow an
           alarm for their journeys.

04:010:007 But when the congregation is to be gathered together, ye shall
           blow, but ye shall not sound an alarm.

04:010:008 And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow with the
           trumpets; and they shall be to you for an ordinance for ever
           throughout your generations.

04:010:009 And if ye go to war in your land against the enemy that
           oppresseth you, then ye shall blow an alarm with the trumpets;
           and ye shall be remembered before the LORD your God, and ye
           shall be saved from your enemies.

04:010:010 Also in the day of your gladness, and in your solemn days, and
           in the beginnings of your months, ye shall blow with the
           trumpets over your burnt offerings, and over the sacrifices of
           your peace offerings; that they may be to you for a memorial
           before your God: I am the LORD your God.

04:010:011 And it came to pass on the twentieth day of the second month,
           in the second year, that the cloud was taken up from off the
           tabernacle of the testimony.

04:010:012 And the children of Israel took their journeys out of the
           wilderness of Sinai; and the cloud rested in the wilderness of
           Paran.

04:010:013 And they first took their journey according to the commandment
           of the LORD by the hand of Moses.

04:010:014 In the first place went the standard of the camp of the
           children of Judah according to their armies: and over his host
           was Nahshon the son of Amminadab.

04:010:015 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Issachar was
           Nethaneel the son of Zuar.

04:010:016 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Zebulun was
           Eliab the son of Helon.

04:010:017 And the tabernacle was taken down; and the sons of Gershon and
           the sons of Merari set forward, bearing the tabernacle.

04:010:018 And the standard of the camp of Reuben set forward according
           to their armies: and over his host was Elizur the son of
           Shedeur.

04:010:019 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Simeon was
           Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai.

04:010:020 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Gad was
           Eliasaph the son of Deuel.

04:010:021 And the Kohathites set forward, bearing the sanctuary: and the
           other did set up the tabernacle against they came.

04:010:022 And the standard of the camp of the children of Ephraim set
           forward according to their armies: and over his host was
           Elishama the son of Ammihud.

04:010:023 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Manasseh was
           Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur.

04:010:024 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Benjamin was
           Abidan the son of Gideoni.

04:010:025 And the standard of the camp of the children of Dan set
           forward, which was the rereward of all the camps throughout
           their hosts: and over his host was Ahiezer the son of
           Ammishaddai.

04:010:026 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Asher was
           Pagiel the son of Ocran.

04:010:027 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Naphtali was
           Ahira the son of Enan.

04:010:028 Thus were the journeyings of the children of Israel according
           to their armies, when they set forward.

04:010:029 And Moses said unto Hobab, the son of Raguel the Midianite,
           Moses' father in law, We are journeying unto the place of
           which the LORD said, I will give it you: come thou with us,
           and we will do thee good: for the LORD hath spoken good
           concerning Israel.

04:010:030 And he said unto him, I will not go; but I will depart to mine
           own land, and to my kindred.

04:010:031 And he said, Leave us not, I pray thee; forasmuch as thou
           knowest how we are to encamp in the wilderness, and thou
           mayest be to us instead of eyes.

04:010:032 And it shall be, if thou go with us, yea, it shall be, that
           what goodness the LORD shall do unto us, the same will we do
           unto thee.

04:010:033 And they departed from the mount of the LORD three days'
           journey: and the ark of the covenant of the LORD went before
           them in the three days' journey, to search out a resting place
           for them.

04:010:034 And the cloud of the LORD was upon them by day, when they went
           out of the camp.

04:010:035 And it came to pass, when the ark set forward, that Moses
           said, Rise up, LORD, and let thine enemies be scattered; and
           let them that hate thee flee before thee.

04:010:036 And when it rested, he said, Return, O LORD, unto the many
           thousands of Israel.

04:011:001 And when the people complained, it displeased the LORD: and
           the LORD heard it; and his anger was kindled; and the fire of
           the LORD burnt among them, and consumed them that were in the
           uttermost parts of the camp.

04:011:002 And the people cried unto Moses; and when Moses prayed unto
           the LORD, the fire was quenched.

04:011:003 And he called the name of the place Taberah: because the fire
           of the LORD burnt among them.

04:011:004 And the mixt multitude that was among them fell a lusting: and
           the children of Israel also wept again, and said, Who shall
           give us flesh to eat?

04:011:005 We remember the fish, which we did eat in Egypt freely; the
           cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and
           the garlick:

04:011:006 But now our soul is dried away: there is nothing at all,
           beside this manna, before our eyes.

04:011:007 And the manna was as coriander seed, and the colour thereof as
           the colour of bdellium.

04:011:008 And the people went about, and gathered it, and ground it in
           mills, or beat it in a mortar, and baked it in pans, and made
           cakes of it: and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh
           oil.

04:011:009 And when the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna
           fell upon it.

04:011:010 Then Moses heard the people weep throughout their families,
           every man in the door of his tent: and the anger of the LORD
           was kindled greatly; Moses also was displeased.

04:011:011 And Moses said unto the LORD, Wherefore hast thou afflicted
           thy servant? and wherefore have I not found favour in thy
           sight, that thou layest the burden of all this people upon me?

04:011:012 Have I conceived all this people? have I begotten them, that
           thou shouldest say unto me, Carry them in thy bosom, as a
           nursing father beareth the sucking child, unto the land which
           thou swarest unto their fathers?

04:011:013 Whence should I have flesh to give unto all this people? for
           they weep unto me, saying, Give us flesh, that we may eat.

04:011:014 I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is too
           heavy for me.

04:011:015 And if thou deal thus with me, kill me, I pray thee, out of
           hand, if I have found favour in thy sight; and let me not see
           my wretchedness.

04:011:016 And the LORD said unto Moses, Gather unto me seventy men of
           the elders of Israel, whom thou knowest to be the elders of
           the people, and officers over them; and bring them unto the
           tabernacle of the congregation, that they may stand there with
           thee.

04:011:017 And I will come down and talk with thee there: and I will take
           of the spirit which is upon thee, and will put it upon them;
           and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee, that
           thou bear it not thyself alone.

04:011:018 And say thou unto the people, Sanctify yourselves against to
           morrow, and ye shall eat flesh: for ye have wept in the ears
           of the LORD, saying, Who shall give us flesh to eat? for it
           was well with us in Egypt: therefore the LORD will give you
           flesh, and ye shall eat.

04:011:019 Ye shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither
           ten days, nor twenty days;

04:011:020 But even a whole month, until it come out at your nostrils,
           and it be loathsome unto you: because that ye have despised
           the LORD which is among you, and have wept before him, saying,
           Why came we forth out of Egypt?

04:011:021 And Moses said, The people, among whom I am, are six hundred
           thousand footmen; and thou hast said, I will give them flesh,
           that they may eat a whole month.

04:011:022 Shall the flocks and the herds be slain for them, to suffice
           them? or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together
           for them, to suffice them?

04:011:023 And the LORD said unto Moses, Is the LORD's hand waxed short?
           thou shalt see now whether my word shall come to pass unto
           thee or not.

04:011:024 And Moses went out, and told the people the words of the LORD,
           and gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people, and
           set them round about the tabernacle.

04:011:025 And the LORD came down in a cloud, and spake unto him, and
           took of the spirit that was upon him, and gave it unto the
           seventy elders: and it came to pass, that, when the spirit
           rested upon them, they prophesied, and did not cease.

04:011:026 But there remained two of the men in the camp, the name of the
           one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad: and the spirit
           rested upon them; and they were of them that were written, but
           went not out unto the tabernacle: and they prophesied in the
           camp.

04:011:027 And there ran a young man, and told Moses, and said, Eldad and
           Medad do prophesy in the camp.

04:011:028 And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Moses, one of his
           young men, answered and said, My lord Moses, forbid them.

04:011:029 And Moses said unto him, Enviest thou for my sake? would God
           that all the LORD's people were prophets, and that the LORD
           would put his spirit upon them!

04:011:030 And Moses gat him into the camp, he and the elders of Israel.

04:011:031 And there went forth a wind from the LORD, and brought quails
           from the sea, and let them fall by the camp, as it were a
           day's journey on this side, and as it were a day's journey on
           the other side, round about the camp, and as it were two
           cubits high upon the face of the earth.

04:011:032 And the people stood up all that day, and all that night, and
           all the next day, and they gathered the quails: he that
           gathered least gathered ten homers: and they spread them all
           abroad for themselves round about the camp.

04:011:033 And while the flesh was yet between their teeth, ere it was
           chewed, the wrath of the LORD was kindled against the people,
           and the LORD smote the people with a very great plague.

04:011:034 And he called the name of that place Kibrothhattaavah: because
           there they buried the people that lusted.

04:011:035 And the people journeyed from Kibrothhattaavah unto Hazeroth;
           and abode at Hazeroth.

04:012:001 And Miriam and Aaron spake against Moses because of the
           Ethiopian woman whom he had married: for he had married an
           Ethiopian woman.

04:012:002 And they said, Hath the LORD indeed spoken only by Moses? hath
           he not spoken also by us? And the LORD heard it.

04:012:003 (Now the man Moses was very meek, above all the men which were
           upon the face of the earth.)

04:012:004 And the LORD spake suddenly unto Moses, and unto Aaron, and
           unto Miriam, Come out ye three unto the tabernacle of the
           congregation. And they three came out.

04:012:005 And the LORD came down in the pillar of the cloud, and stood
           in the door of the tabernacle, and called Aaron and Miriam:
           and they both came forth.

04:012:006 And he said, Hear now my words: If there be a prophet among
           you, I the LORD will make myself known unto him in a vision,
           and will speak unto him in a dream.

04:012:007 My servant Moses is not so, who is faithful in all mine house.

04:012:008 With him will I speak mouth to mouth, even apparently, and not
           in dark speeches; and the similitude of the LORD shall he
           behold: wherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against my
           servant Moses?

04:012:009 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against them; and he
           departed.

04:012:010 And the cloud departed from off the tabernacle; and, behold,
           Miriam became leprous, white as snow: and Aaron looked upon
           Miriam, and, behold, she was leprous.

04:012:011 And Aaron said unto Moses, Alas, my lord, I beseech thee, lay
           not the sin upon us, wherein we have done foolishly, and
           wherein we have sinned.

04:012:012 Let her not be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half consumed
           when he cometh out of his mother's womb.

04:012:013 And Moses cried unto the LORD, saying, Heal her now, O God, I
           beseech thee.

04:012:014 And the LORD said unto Moses, If her father had but spit in
           her face, should she not be ashamed seven days? let her be
           shut out from the camp seven days, and after that let her be
           received in again.

04:012:015 And Miriam was shut out from the camp seven days: and the
           people journeyed not till Miriam was brought in again.

04:012:016 And afterward the people removed from Hazeroth, and pitched in
           the wilderness of Paran.

04:013:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

04:013:002 Send thou men, that they may search the land of Canaan, which
           I give unto the children of Israel: of every tribe of their
           fathers shall ye send a man, every one a ruler among them.

04:013:003 And Moses by the commandment of the LORD sent them from the
           wilderness of Paran: all those men were heads of the children
           of Israel.

04:013:004 And these were their names: of the tribe of Reuben, Shammua
           the son of Zaccur.

04:013:005 Of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori.

04:013:006 Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh.

04:013:007 Of the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph.

04:013:008 Of the tribe of Ephraim, Oshea the son of Nun.

04:013:009 Of the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu.

04:013:010 Of the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi.

04:013:011 Of the tribe of Joseph, namely, of the tribe of Manasseh,
           Gaddi the son of Susi.

04:013:012 Of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli.

04:013:013 Of the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael.

04:013:014 Of the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi.

04:013:015 Of the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi.

04:013:016 These are the names of the men which Moses sent to spy out the
           land. And Moses called Oshea the son of Nun Jehoshua.

04:013:017 And Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said
           unto them, Get you up this way southward, and go up into the
           mountain:

04:013:018 And see the land, what it is, and the people that dwelleth
           therein, whether they be strong or weak, few or many;

04:013:019 And what the land is that they dwell in, whether it be good or
           bad; and what cities they be that they dwell in, whether in
           tents, or in strong holds;

04:013:020 And what the land is, whether it be fat or lean, whether there
           be wood therein, or not. And be ye of good courage, and bring
           of the fruit of the land. Now the time was the time of the
           firstripe grapes.

04:013:021 So they went up, and searched the land from the wilderness of
           Zin unto Rehob, as men come to Hamath.

04:013:022 And they ascended by the south, and came unto Hebron; where
           Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, were. (Now
           Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)

04:013:023 And they came unto the brook of Eshcol, and cut down from
           thence a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bare it
           between two upon a staff; and they brought of the
           pomegranates, and of the figs.

04:013:024 The place was called the brook Eshcol, because of the cluster
           of grapes which the children of Israel cut down from thence.

04:013:025 And they returned from searching of the land after forty days.

04:013:026 And they went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the
           congregation of the children of Israel, unto the wilderness of
           Paran, to Kadesh; and brought back word unto them, and unto
           all the congregation, and shewed them the fruit of the land.

04:013:027 And they told him, and said, We came unto the land whither
           thou sentest us, and surely it floweth with milk and honey;
           and this is the fruit of it.

04:013:028 Nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the land, and
           the cities are walled, and very great: and moreover we saw the
           children of Anak there.

04:013:029 The Amalekites dwell in the land of the south: and the
           Hittites, and the Jebusites, and the Amorites, dwell in the
           mountains: and the Canaanites dwell by the sea, and by the
           coast of Jordan.

04:013:030 And Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, Let us go
           up at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome
           it.

04:013:031 But the men that went up with him said, We be not able to go
           up against the people; for they are stronger than we.

04:013:032 And they brought up an evil report of the land which they had
           searched unto the children of Israel, saying, The land,
           through which we have gone to search it, is a land that eateth
           up the inhabitants thereof; and all the people that we saw in
           it are men of a great stature.

04:013:033 And there we saw the giants, the sons of Anak, which come of
           the giants: and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and
           so we were in their sight.

04:014:001 And all the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; and
           the people wept that night.

04:014:002 And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and
           against Aaron: and the whole congregation said unto them,
           Would God that we had died in the land of Egypt! or would God
           we had died in this wilderness!

04:014:003 And wherefore hath the LORD brought us unto this land, to fall
           by the sword, that our wives and our children should be a
           prey? were it not better for us to return into Egypt?

04:014:004 And they said one to another, Let us make a captain, and let
           us return into Egypt.

04:014:005 Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the
           assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel.

04:014:006 And Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh,
           which were of them that searched the land, rent their clothes:

04:014:007 And they spake unto all the company of the children of Israel,
           saying, The land, which we passed through to search it, is an
           exceeding good land.

04:014:008 If the LORD delight in us, then he will bring us into this
           land, and give it us; a land which floweth with milk and
           honey.

04:014:009 Only rebel not ye against the LORD, neither fear ye the people
           of the land; for they are bread for us: their defence is
           departed from them, and the LORD is with us: fear them not.

04:014:010 But all the congregation bade stone them with stones. And the
           glory of the LORD appeared in the tabernacle of the
           congregation before all the children of Israel.

04:014:011 And the LORD said unto Moses, How long will this people
           provoke me? and how long will it be ere they believe me, for
           all the signs which I have shewed among them?

04:014:012 I will smite them with the pestilence, and disinherit them,
           and will make of thee a greater nation and mightier than they.

04:014:013 And Moses said unto the LORD, Then the Egyptians shall hear
           it, (for thou broughtest up this people in thy might from
           among them;)

04:014:014 And they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land: for
           they have heard that thou LORD art among this people, that
           thou LORD art seen face to face, and that thy cloud standeth
           over them, and that thou goest before them, by day time in a
           pillar of a cloud, and in a pillar of fire by night.

04:014:015 Now if thou shalt kill all this people as one man, then the
           nations which have heard the fame of thee will speak, saying,

04:014:016 Because the LORD was not able to bring this people into the
           land which he sware unto them, therefore he hath slain them in
           the wilderness.

04:014:017 And now, I beseech thee, let the power of my Lord be great,
           according as thou hast spoken, saying,

04:014:018 The LORD is longsuffering, and of great mercy, forgiving
           iniquity and transgression, and by no means clearing the
           guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children
           unto the third and fourth generation.

04:014:019 Pardon, I beseech thee, the iniquity of this people according
           unto the greatness of thy mercy, and as thou hast forgiven
           this people, from Egypt even until now.

04:014:020 And the LORD said, I have pardoned according to thy word:

04:014:021 But as truly as I live, all the earth shall be filled with the
           glory of the LORD.

04:014:022 Because all those men which have seen my glory, and my
           miracles, which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and have
           tempted me now these ten times, and have not hearkened to my
           voice;

04:014:023 Surely they shall not see the land which I sware unto their
           fathers, neither shall any of them that provoked me see it:

04:014:024 But my servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him,
           and hath followed me fully, him will I bring into the land
           whereinto he went; and his seed shall possess it.

04:014:025 (Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwelt in the valley.)
           Tomorrow turn you, and get you into the wilderness by the way
           of the Red sea.

04:014:026 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,

04:014:027 How long shall I bear with this evil congregation, which
           murmur against me? I have heard the murmurings of the children
           of Israel, which they murmur against me.

04:014:028 Say unto them, As truly as I live, saith the LORD, as ye have
           spoken in mine ears, so will I do to you:

04:014:029 Your carcases shall fall in this wilderness; and all that were
           numbered of you, according to your whole number, from twenty
           years old and upward which have murmured against me.

04:014:030 Doubtless ye shall not come into the land, concerning which I
           sware to make you dwell therein, save Caleb the son of
           Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.

04:014:031 But your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, them
           will I bring in, and they shall know the land which ye have
           despised.

04:014:032 But as for you, your carcases, they shall fall in this
           wilderness.

04:014:033 And your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years,
           and bear your whoredoms, until your carcases be wasted in the
           wilderness.

04:014:034 After the number of the days in which ye searched the land,
           even forty days, each day for a year, shall ye bear your
           iniquities, even forty years, and ye shall know my breach of
           promise.

04:014:035 I the LORD have said, I will surely do it unto all this evil
           congregation, that are gathered together against me: in this
           wilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die.

04:014:036 And the men, which Moses sent to search the land, who
           returned, and made all the congregation to murmur against him,
           by bringing up a slander upon the land,

04:014:037 Even those men that did bring up the evil report upon the
           land, died by the plague before the LORD.

04:014:038 But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh,
           which were of the men that went to search the land, lived
           still.

04:014:039 And Moses told these sayings unto all the children of Israel:
           and the people mourned greatly.

04:014:040 And they rose up early in the morning, and gat them up into
           the top of the mountain, saying, Lo, we be here, and will go
           up unto the place which the LORD hath promised: for we have
           sinned.

04:014:041 And Moses said, Wherefore now do ye transgress the commandment
           of the LORD? but it shall not prosper.

04:014:042 Go not up, for the LORD is not among you; that ye be not
           smitten before your enemies.

04:014:043 For the Amalekites and the Canaanites are there before you,
           and ye shall fall by the sword: because ye are turned away
           from the LORD, therefore the LORD will not be with you.

04:014:044 But they presumed to go up unto the hill top: nevertheless the
           ark of the covenant of the LORD, and Moses, departed not out
           of the camp.

04:014:045 Then the Amalekites came down, and the Canaanites which dwelt
           in that hill, and smote them, and discomfited them, even unto
           Hormah.

04:015:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

04:015:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye
           be come into the land of your habitations, which I give unto
           you,

04:015:003 And will make an offering by fire unto the LORD, a burnt
           offering, or a sacrifice in performing a vow, or in a freewill
           offering, or in your solemn feasts, to make a sweet savour
           unto the LORD, of the herd or of the flock:

04:015:004 Then shall he that offereth his offering unto the LORD bring a
           meat offering of a tenth deal of flour mingled with the fourth
           part of an hin of oil.

04:015:005 And the fourth part of an hin of wine for a drink offering
           shalt thou prepare with the burnt offering or sacrifice, for
           one lamb.

04:015:006 Or for a ram, thou shalt prepare for a meat offering two tenth
           deals of flour mingled with the third part of an hin of oil.

04:015:007 And for a drink offering thou shalt offer the third part of an
           hin of wine, for a sweet savour unto the LORD.

04:015:008 And when thou preparest a bullock for a burnt offering, or for
           a sacrifice in performing a vow, or peace offerings unto the
           LORD:

04:015:009 Then shall he bring with a bullock a meat offering of three
           tenth deals of flour mingled with half an hin of oil.

04:015:010 And thou shalt bring for a drink offering half an hin of wine,
           for an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.

04:015:011 Thus shall it be done for one bullock, or for one ram, or for
           a lamb, or a kid.

04:015:012 According to the number that ye shall prepare, so shall ye do
           to every one according to their number.

04:015:013 All that are born of the country shall do these things after
           this manner, in offering an offering made by fire, of a sweet
           savour unto the LORD.

04:015:014 And if a stranger sojourn with you, or whosoever be among you
           in your generations, and will offer an offering made by fire,
           of a sweet savour unto the LORD; as ye do, so he shall do.

04:015:015 One ordinance shall be both for you of the congregation, and
           also for the stranger that sojourneth with you, an ordinance
           for ever in your generations: as ye are, so shall the stranger
           be before the LORD.

04:015:016 One law and one manner shall be for you, and for the stranger
           that sojourneth with you.

04:015:017 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

04:015:018 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye
           come into the land whither I bring you,

04:015:019 Then it shall be, that, when ye eat of the bread of the land,
           ye shall offer up an heave offering unto the LORD.

04:015:020 Ye shall offer up a cake of the first of your dough for an
           heave offering: as ye do the heave offering of the
           threshingfloor, so shall ye heave it.

04:015:021 Of the first of your dough ye shall give unto the LORD an
           heave offering in your generations.

04:015:022 And if ye have erred, and not observed all these commandments,
           which the LORD hath spoken unto Moses,

04:015:023 Even all that the LORD hath commanded you by the hand of
           Moses, from the day that the LORD commanded Moses, and
           henceforward among your generations;

04:015:024 Then it shall be, if ought be committed by ignorance without
           the knowledge of the congregation, that all the congregation
           shall offer one young bullock for a burnt offering, for a
           sweet savour unto the LORD, with his meat offering, and his
           drink offering, according to the manner, and one kid of the
           goats for a sin offering.

04:015:025 And the priest shall make an atonement for all the
           congregation of the children of Israel, and it shall be
           forgiven them; for it is ignorance: and they shall bring their
           offering, a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD, and their
           sin offering before the LORD, for their ignorance:

04:015:026 And it shall be forgiven all the congregation of the children
           of Israel, and the stranger that sojourneth among them; seeing
           all the people were in ignorance.

04:015:027 And if any soul sin through ignorance, then he shall bring a
           she goat of the first year for a sin offering.

04:015:028 And the priest shall make an atonement for the soul that
           sinneth ignorantly, when he sinneth by ignorance before the
           LORD, to make an atonement for him; and it shall be forgiven
           him.

04:015:029 Ye shall have one law for him that sinneth through ignorance,
           both for him that is born among the children of Israel, and
           for the stranger that sojourneth among them.

04:015:030 But the soul that doeth ought presumptuously, whether he be
           born in the land, or a stranger, the same reproacheth the
           LORD; and that soul shall be cut off from among his people.

04:015:031 Because he hath despised the word of the LORD, and hath broken
           his commandment, that soul shall utterly be cut off; his
           iniquity shall be upon him.

04:015:032 And while the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they
           found a man that gathered sticks upon the sabbath day.

04:015:033 And they that found him gathering sticks brought him unto
           Moses and Aaron, and unto all the congregation.

04:015:034 And they put him in ward, because it was not declared what
           should be done to him.

04:015:035 And the LORD said unto Moses, The man shall be surely put to
           death: all the congregation shall stone him with stones
           without the camp.

04:015:036 And all the congregation brought him without the camp, and
           stoned him with stones, and he died; as the LORD commanded
           Moses.

04:015:037 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

04:015:038 Speak unto the children of Israel, and bid them that they make
           them fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their
           generations, and that they put upon the fringe of the borders
           a ribband of blue:

04:015:039 And it shall be unto you for a fringe, that ye may look upon
           it, and remember all the commandments of the LORD, and do
           them; and that ye seek not after your own heart and your own
           eyes, after which ye use to go a whoring:

04:015:040 That ye may remember, and do all my commandments, and be holy
           unto your God.

04:015:041 I am the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of
           Egypt, to be your God: I am the LORD your God.

04:016:001 Now Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of
           Levi, and Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On, the
           son of Peleth, sons of Reuben, took men:

04:016:002 And they rose up before Moses, with certain of the children of
           Israel, two hundred and fifty princes of the assembly, famous
           in the congregation, men of renown:

04:016:003 And they gathered themselves together against Moses and
           against Aaron, and said unto them, Ye take too much upon you,
           seeing all the congregation are holy, every one of them, and
           the LORD is among them: wherefore then lift ye up yourselves
           above the congregation of the LORD?

04:016:004 And when Moses heard it, he fell upon his face:

04:016:005 And he spake unto Korah and unto all his company, saying, Even
           to morrow the LORD will shew who are his, and who is holy; and
           will cause him to come near unto him: even him whom he hath
           chosen will he cause to come near unto him.

04:016:006 This do; Take you censers, Korah, and all his company;

04:016:007 And put fire therein, and put incense in them before the LORD
           to morrow: and it shall be that the man whom the LORD doth
           choose, he shall be holy: ye take too much upon you, ye sons
           of Levi.

04:016:008 And Moses said unto Korah, Hear, I pray you, ye sons of Levi:

04:016:009 Seemeth it but a small thing unto you, that the God of Israel
           hath separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring
           you near to himself to do the service of the tabernacle of the
           LORD, and to stand before the congregation to minister unto
           them?

04:016:010 And he hath brought thee near to him, and all thy brethren the
           sons of Levi with thee: and seek ye the priesthood also?

04:016:011 For which cause both thou and all thy company are gathered
           together against the LORD: and what is Aaron, that ye murmur
           against him?

04:016:012 And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab:
           which said, We will not come up:

04:016:013 Is it a small thing that thou hast brought us up out of a land
           that floweth with milk and honey, to kill us in the
           wilderness, except thou make thyself altogether a prince over
           us?

04:016:014 Moreover thou hast not brought us into a land that floweth
           with milk and honey, or given us inheritance of fields and
           vineyards: wilt thou put out the eyes of these men? we will
           not come up.

04:016:015 And Moses was very wroth, and said unto the LORD, Respect not
           thou their offering: I have not taken one ass from them,
           neither have I hurt one of them.

04:016:016 And Moses said unto Korah, Be thou and all thy company before
           the LORD, thou, and they, and Aaron, to morrow:

04:016:017 And take every man his censer, and put incense in them, and
           bring ye before the LORD every man his censer, two hundred and
           fifty censers; thou also, and Aaron, each of you his censer.

04:016:018 And they took every man his censer, and put fire in them, and
           laid incense thereon, and stood in the door of the tabernacle
           of the congregation with Moses and Aaron.

04:016:019 And Korah gathered all the congregation against them unto the
           door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and the glory of
           the LORD appeared unto all the congregation.

04:016:020 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,

04:016:021 Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may
           consume them in a moment.

04:016:022 And they fell upon their faces, and said, O God, the God of
           the spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and wilt thou be
           wroth with all the congregation?

04:016:023 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

04:016:024 Speak unto the congregation, saying, Get you up from about the
           tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.

04:016:025 And Moses rose up and went unto Dathan and Abiram; and the
           elders of Israel followed him.

04:016:026 And he spake unto the congregation, saying, Depart, I pray
           you, from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of
           their's, lest ye be consumed in all their sins.

04:016:027 So they gat up from the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and
           Abiram, on every side: and Dathan and Abiram came out, and
           stood in the door of their tents, and their wives, and their
           sons, and their little children.

04:016:028 And Moses said, Hereby ye shall know that the LORD hath sent
           me to do all these works; for I have not done them of mine own
           mind.

04:016:029 If these men die the common death of all men, or if they be
           visited after the visitation of all men; then the LORD hath
           not sent me.

04:016:030 But if the LORD make a new thing, and the earth open her
           mouth, and swallow them up, with all that appertain unto them,
           and they go down quick into the pit; then ye shall understand
           that these men have provoked the LORD.

04:016:031 And it came to pass, as he had made an end of speaking all
           these words, that the ground clave asunder that was under
           them:

04:016:032 And the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and
           their houses, and all the men that appertained unto Korah, and
           all their goods.

04:016:033 They, and all that appertained to them, went down alive into
           the pit, and the earth closed upon them: and they perished
           from among the congregation.

04:016:034 And all Israel that were round about them fled at the cry of
           them: for they said, Lest the earth swallow us up also.

04:016:035 And there came out a fire from the LORD, and consumed the two
           hundred and fifty men that offered incense.

04:016:036 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

04:016:037 Speak unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he take
           up the censers out of the burning, and scatter thou the fire
           yonder; for they are hallowed.

04:016:038 The censers of these sinners against their own souls, let them
           make them broad plates for a covering of the altar: for they
           offered them before the LORD, therefore they are hallowed: and
           they shall be a sign unto the children of Israel.

04:016:039 And Eleazar the priest took the brasen censers, wherewith they
           that were burnt had offered; and they were made broad plates
           for a covering of the altar:

04:016:040 To be a memorial unto the children of Israel, that no
           stranger, which is not of the seed of Aaron, come near to
           offer incense before the LORD; that he be not as Korah, and as
           his company: as the LORD said to him by the hand of Moses.

04:016:041 But on the morrow all the congregation of the children of
           Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying, Ye
           have killed the people of the LORD.

04:016:042 And it came to pass, when the congregation was gathered
           against Moses and against Aaron, that they looked toward the
           tabernacle of the congregation: and, behold, the cloud covered
           it, and the glory of the LORD appeared.

04:016:043 And Moses and Aaron came before the tabernacle of the
           congregation.

04:016:044 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

04:016:045 Get you up from among this congregation, that I may consume
           them as in a moment. And they fell upon their faces.

04:016:046 And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a censer, and put fire therein
           from off the altar, and put on incense, and go quickly unto
           the congregation, and make an atonement for them: for there is
           wrath gone out from the LORD; the plague is begun.

04:016:047 And Aaron took as Moses commanded, and ran into the midst of
           the congregation; and, behold, the plague was begun among the
           people: and he put on incense, and made an atonement for the
           people.

04:016:048 And he stood between the dead and the living; and the plague
           was stayed.

04:016:049 Now they that died in the plague were fourteen thousand and
           seven hundred, beside them that died about the matter of
           Korah.

04:016:050 And Aaron returned unto Moses unto the door of the tabernacle
           of the congregation: and the plague was stayed.

04:017:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

04:017:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, and take of every one of
           them a rod according to the house of their fathers, of all
           their princes according to the house of their fathers twelve
           rods: write thou every man's name upon his rod.

04:017:003 And thou shalt write Aaron's name upon the rod of Levi: for
           one rod shall be for the head of the house of their fathers.

04:017:004 And thou shalt lay them up in the tabernacle of the
           congregation before the testimony, where I will meet with you.

04:017:005 And it shall come to pass, that the man's rod, whom I shall
           choose, shall blossom: and I will make to cease from me the
           murmurings of the children of Israel, whereby they murmur
           against you.

04:017:006 And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, and every one of
           their princes gave him a rod apiece, for each prince one,
           according to their fathers' houses, even twelve rods: and the
           rod of Aaron was among their rods.

04:017:007 And Moses laid up the rods before the LORD in the tabernacle
           of witness.

04:017:008 And it came to pass, that on the morrow Moses went into the
           tabernacle of witness; and, behold, the rod of Aaron for the
           house of Levi was budded, and brought forth buds, and bloomed
           blossoms, and yielded almonds.

04:017:009 And Moses brought out all the rods from before the LORD unto
           all the children of Israel: and they looked, and took every
           man his rod.

04:017:010 And the LORD said unto Moses, Bring Aaron's rod again before
           the testimony, to be kept for a token against the rebels; and
           thou shalt quite take away their murmurings from me, that they
           die not.

04:017:011 And Moses did so: as the LORD commanded him, so did he.

04:017:012 And the children of Israel spake unto Moses, saying, Behold,
           we die, we perish, we all perish.

04:017:013 Whosoever cometh any thing near unto the tabernacle of the
           LORD shall die: shall we be consumed with dying?

04:018:001 And the LORD said unto Aaron, Thou and thy sons and thy
           father's house with thee shall bear the iniquity of the
           sanctuary: and thou and thy sons with thee shall bear the
           iniquity of your priesthood.

04:018:002 And thy brethren also of the tribe of Levi, the tribe of thy
           father, bring thou with thee, that they may be joined unto
           thee, and minister unto thee: but thou and thy sons with thee
           shall minister before the tabernacle of witness.

04:018:003 And they shall keep thy charge, and the charge of all the
           tabernacle: only they shall not come nigh the vessels of the
           sanctuary and the altar, that neither they, nor ye also, die.

04:018:004 And they shall be joined unto thee, and keep the charge of the
           tabernacle of the congregation, for all the service of the
           tabernacle: and a stranger shall not come nigh unto you.

04:018:005 And ye shall keep the charge of the sanctuary, and the charge
           of the altar: that there be no wrath any more upon the
           children of Israel.

04:018:006 And I, behold, I have taken your brethren the Levites from
           among the children of Israel: to you they are given as a gift
           for the LORD, to do the service of the tabernacle of the
           congregation.

04:018:007 Therefore thou and thy sons with thee shall keep your priest's
           office for everything of the altar, and within the vail; and
           ye shall serve: I have given your priest's office unto you as
           a service of gift: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be
           put to death.

04:018:008 And the LORD spake unto Aaron, Behold, I also have given thee
           the charge of mine heave offerings of all the hallowed things
           of the children of Israel; unto thee have I given them by
           reason of the anointing, and to thy sons, by an ordinance for
           ever.

04:018:009 This shall be thine of the most holy things, reserved from the
           fire: every oblation of their's, every meat offering of
           their's, and every sin offering of their's, and every trespass
           offering of their's which they shall render unto me, shall be
           most holy for thee and for thy sons.

04:018:010 In the most holy place shalt thou eat it; every male shall eat
           it: it shall be holy unto thee.

04:018:011 And this is thine; the heave offering of their gift, with all
           the wave offerings of the children of Israel: I have given
           them unto thee, and to thy sons and to thy daughters with
           thee, by a statute for ever: every one that is clean in thy
           house shall eat of it.

04:018:012 All the best of the oil, and all the best of the wine, and of
           the wheat, the firstfruits of them which they shall offer unto
           the LORD, them have I given thee.

04:018:013 And whatsoever is first ripe in the land, which they shall
           bring unto the LORD, shall be thine; every one that is clean
           in thine house shall eat of it.

04:018:014 Every thing devoted in Israel shall be thine.

04:018:015 Every thing that openeth the matrix in all flesh, which they
           bring unto the LORD, whether it be of men or beasts, shall be
           thine: nevertheless the firstborn of man shalt thou surely
           redeem, and the firstling of unclean beasts shalt thou redeem.

04:018:016 And those that are to be redeemed from a month old shalt thou
           redeem, according to thine estimation, for the money of five
           shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, which is twenty
           gerahs.

04:018:017 But the firstling of a cow, or the firstling of a sheep, or
           the firstling of a goat, thou shalt not redeem; they are holy:
           thou shalt sprinkle their blood upon the altar, and shalt burn
           their fat for an offering made by fire, for a sweet savour
           unto the LORD.

04:018:018 And the flesh of them shall be thine, as the wave breast and
           as the right shoulder are thine.

04:018:019 All the heave offerings of the holy things, which the children
           of Israel offer unto the LORD, have I given thee, and thy sons
           and thy daughters with thee, by a statute for ever: it is a
           covenant of salt for ever before the LORD unto thee and to thy
           seed with thee.

04:018:020 And the LORD spake unto Aaron, Thou shalt have no inheritance
           in their land, neither shalt thou have any part among them: I
           am thy part and thine inheritance among the children of
           Israel.

04:018:021 And, behold, I have given the children of Levi all the tenth
           in Israel for an inheritance, for their service which they
           serve, even the service of the tabernacle of the congregation.

04:018:022 Neither must the children of Israel henceforth come nigh the
           tabernacle of the congregation, lest they bear sin, and die.

04:018:023 But the Levites shall do the service of the tabernacle of the
           congregation, and they shall bear their iniquity: it shall be
           a statute for ever throughout your generations, that among the
           children of Israel they have no inheritance.

04:018:024 But the tithes of the children of Israel, which they offer as
           an heave offering unto the LORD, I have given to the Levites
           to inherit: therefore I have said unto them, Among the
           children of Israel they shall have no inheritance.

04:018:025 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

04:018:026 Thus speak unto the Levites, and say unto them, When ye take
           of the children of Israel the tithes which I have given you
           from them for your inheritance, then ye shall offer up an
           heave offering of it for the LORD, even a tenth part of the
           tithe.

04:018:027 And this your heave offering shall be reckoned unto you, as
           though it were the corn of the threshingfloor, and as the
           fulness of the winepress.

04:018:028 Thus ye also shall offer an heave offering unto the LORD of
           all your tithes, which ye receive of the children of Israel;
           and ye shall give thereof the LORD's heave offering to Aaron
           the priest.

04:018:029 Out of all your gifts ye shall offer every heave offering of
           the LORD, of all the best thereof, even the hallowed part
           thereof out of it.

04:018:030 Therefore thou shalt say unto them, When ye have heaved the
           best thereof from it, then it shall be counted unto the
           Levites as the increase of the threshingfloor, and as the
           increase of the winepress.

04:018:031 And ye shall eat it in every place, ye and your households:
           for it is your reward for your service in the tabernacle of
           the congregation.

04:018:032 And ye shall bear no sin by reason of it, when ye have heaved
           from it the best of it: neither shall ye pollute the holy
           things of the children of Israel, lest ye die.

04:019:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,

04:019:002 This is the ordinance of the law which the LORD hath
           commanded, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, that
           they bring thee a red heifer without spot, wherein is no
           blemish, and upon which never came yoke:

04:019:003 And ye shall give her unto Eleazar the priest, that he may
           bring her forth without the camp, and one shall slay her
           before his face:

04:019:004 And Eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his
           finger, and sprinkle of her blood directly before the
           tabernacle of the congregation seven times:

04:019:005 And one shall burn the heifer in his sight; her skin, and her
           flesh, and her blood, with her dung, shall he burn:

04:019:006 And the priest shall take cedar wood, and hyssop, and scarlet,
           and cast it into the midst of the burning of the heifer.

04:019:007 Then the priest shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his
           flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp, and
           the priest shall be unclean until the even.

04:019:008 And he that burneth her shall wash his clothes in water, and
           bathe his flesh in water, and shall be unclean until the even.

04:019:009 And a man that is clean shall gather up the ashes of the
           heifer, and lay them up without the camp in a clean place, and
           it shall be kept for the congregation of the children of
           Israel for a water of separation: it is a purification for
           sin.

04:019:010 And he that gathereth the ashes of the heifer shall wash his
           clothes, and be unclean until the even: and it shall be unto
           the children of Israel, and unto the stranger that sojourneth
           among them, for a statute for ever.

04:019:011 He that toucheth the dead body of any man shall be unclean
           seven days.

04:019:012 He shall purify himself with it on the third day, and on the
           seventh day he shall be clean: but if he purify not himself
           the third day, then the seventh day he shall not be clean.

04:019:013 Whosoever toucheth the dead body of any man that is dead, and
           purifieth not himself, defileth the tabernacle of the LORD;
           and that soul shall be cut off from Israel: because the water
           of separation was not sprinkled upon him, he shall be unclean;
           his uncleanness is yet upon him.

04:019:014 This is the law, when a man dieth in a tent: all that come
           into the tent, and all that is in the tent, shall be unclean
           seven days.

04:019:015 And every open vessel, which hath no covering bound upon it,
           is unclean.

04:019:016 And whosoever toucheth one that is slain with a sword in the
           open fields, or a dead body, or a bone of a man, or a grave,
           shall be unclean seven days.

04:019:017 And for an unclean person they shall take of the ashes of the
           burnt heifer of purification for sin, and running water shall
           be put thereto in a vessel:

04:019:018 And a clean person shall take hyssop, and dip it in the water,
           and sprinkle it upon the tent, and upon all the vessels, and
           upon the persons that were there, and upon him that touched a
           bone, or one slain, or one dead, or a grave:

04:019:019 And the clean person shall sprinkle upon the unclean on the
           third day, and on the seventh day: and on the seventh day he
           shall purify himself, and wash his clothes, and bathe himself
           in water, and shall be clean at even.

04:019:020 But the man that shall be unclean, and shall not purify
           himself, that soul shall be cut off from among the
           congregation, because he hath defiled the sanctuary of the
           LORD: the water of separation hath not been sprinkled upon
           him; he is unclean.

04:019:021 And it shall be a perpetual statute unto them, that he that
           sprinkleth the water of separation shall wash his clothes; and
           he that toucheth the water of separation shall be unclean
           until even.

04:019:022 And whatsoever the unclean person toucheth shall be unclean;
           and the soul that toucheth it shall be unclean until even.

04:020:001 Then came the children of Israel, even the whole congregation,
           into the desert of Zin in the first month: and the people
           abode in Kadesh; and Miriam died there, and was buried there.

04:020:002 And there was no water for the congregation: and they gathered
           themselves together against Moses and against Aaron.

04:020:003 And the people chode with Moses, and spake, saying, Would God
           that we had died when our brethren died before the LORD!

04:020:004 And why have ye brought up the congregation of the LORD into
           this wilderness, that we and our cattle should die there?

04:020:005 And wherefore have ye made us to come up out of Egypt, to
           bring us in unto this evil place? it is no place of seed, or
           of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates; neither is there any
           water to drink.

04:020:006 And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly
           unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they
           fell upon their faces: and the glory of the LORD appeared unto
           them.

04:020:007 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

04:020:008 Take the rod, and gather thou the assembly together, thou, and
           Aaron thy brother, and speak ye unto the rock before their
           eyes; and it shall give forth his water, and thou shalt bring
           forth to them water out of the rock: so thou shalt give the
           congregation and their beasts drink.

04:020:009 And Moses took the rod from before the LORD, as he commanded
           him.

04:020:010 And Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before
           the rock, and he said unto them, Hear now, ye rebels; must we
           fetch you water out of this rock?

04:020:011 And Moses lifted up his hand, and with his rod he smote the
           rock twice: and the water came out abundantly, and the
           congregation drank, and their beasts also.

04:020:012 And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron, Because ye believed
           me not, to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel,
           therefore ye shall not bring this congregation into the land
           which I have given them.

04:020:013 This is the water of Meribah; because the children of Israel
           strove with the LORD, and he was sanctified in them.

04:020:014 And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh unto the king of Edom,
           Thus saith thy brother Israel, Thou knowest all the travail
           that hath befallen us:

04:020:015 How our fathers went down into Egypt, and we have dwelt in
           Egypt a long time; and the Egyptians vexed us, and our
           fathers:

04:020:016 And when we cried unto the LORD, he heard our voice, and sent
           an angel, and hath brought us forth out of Egypt: and, behold,
           we are in Kadesh, a city in the uttermost of thy border:

04:020:017 Let us pass, I pray thee, through thy country: we will not
           pass through the fields, or through the vineyards, neither
           will we drink of the water of the wells: we will go by the
           king's high way, we will not turn to the right hand nor to the
           left, until we have passed thy borders.

04:020:018 And Edom said unto him, Thou shalt not pass by me, lest I come
           out against thee with the sword.

04:020:019 And the children of Israel said unto him, We will go by the
           high way: and if I and my cattle drink of thy water, then I
           will pay for it: I will only, without doing anything else, go
           through on my feet.

04:020:020 And he said, Thou shalt not go through. And Edom came out
           against him with much people, and with a strong hand.

04:020:021 Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border:
           wherefore Israel turned away from him.

04:020:022 And the children of Israel, even the whole congregation,
           journeyed from Kadesh, and came unto mount Hor.

04:020:023 And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in mount Hor, by the
           coast of the land of Edom, saying,

04:020:024 Aaron shall be gathered unto his people: for he shall not
           enter into the land which I have given unto the children of
           Israel, because ye rebelled against my word at the water of
           Meribah.

04:020:025 Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up unto mount
           Hor:

04:020:026 And strip Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his
           son: and Aaron shall be gathered unto his people, and shall
           die there.

04:020:027 And Moses did as the LORD commanded: and they went up into
           mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation.

04:020:028 And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them upon
           Eleazar his son; and Aaron died there in the top of the mount:
           and Moses and Eleazar came down from the mount.

04:020:029 And when all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, they
           mourned for Aaron thirty days, even all the house of Israel.

04:021:001 And when king Arad the Canaanite, which dwelt in the south,
           heard tell that Israel came by the way of the spies; then he
           fought against Israel, and took some of them prisoners.

04:021:002 And Israel vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If thou wilt
           indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly
           destroy their cities.

04:021:003 And the LORD hearkened to the voice of Israel, and delivered
           up the Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them and their
           cities: and he called the name of the place Hormah.

04:021:004 And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red sea,
           to compass the land of Edom: and the soul of the people was
           much discouraged because of the way.

04:021:005 And the people spake against God, and against Moses, Wherefore
           have ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness?
           for there is no bread, neither is there any water; and our
           soul loatheth this light bread.

04:021:006 And the LORD sent fiery serpents among the people, and they
           bit the people; and much people of Israel died.

04:021:007 Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned,
           for we have spoken against the LORD, and against thee; pray
           unto the LORD, that he take away the serpents from us. And
           Moses prayed for the people.

04:021:008 And the LORD said unto Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and
           set it upon a pole: and it shall come to pass, that every one
           that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live.

04:021:009 And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole, and
           it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he
           beheld the serpent of brass, he lived.

04:021:010 And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in Oboth.

04:021:011 And they journeyed from Oboth, and pitched at Ijeabarim, in
           the wilderness which is before Moab, toward the sunrising.

04:021:012 From thence they removed, and pitched in the valley of Zared.

04:021:013 From thence they removed, and pitched on the other side of
           Arnon, which is in the wilderness that cometh out of the
           coasts of the Amorites: for Arnon is the border of Moab,
           between Moab and the Amorites.

04:021:014 Wherefore it is said in the book of the wars of the LORD, What
           he did in the Red sea, and in the brooks of Arnon,

04:021:015 And at the stream of the brooks that goeth down to the
           dwelling of Ar, and lieth upon the border of Moab.

04:021:016 And from thence they went to Beer: that is the well whereof
           the LORD spake unto Moses, Gather the people together, and I
           will give them water.

04:021:017 Then Israel sang this song, Spring up, O well; sing ye unto
           it:

04:021:018 The princes digged the well, the nobles of the people digged
           it, by the direction of the lawgiver, with their staves. And
           from the wilderness they went to Mattanah:

04:021:019 And from Mattanah to Nahaliel: and from Nahaliel to Bamoth:

04:021:020 And from Bamoth in the valley, that is in the country of Moab,
           to the top of Pisgah, which looketh toward Jeshimon.

04:021:021 And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites,
           saying,

04:021:022 Let me pass through thy land: we will not turn into the
           fields, or into the vineyards; we will not drink of the waters
           of the well: but we will go along by the king's high way,
           until we be past thy borders.

04:021:023 And Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border:
           but Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out
           against Israel into the wilderness: and he came to Jahaz, and
           fought against Israel.

04:021:024 And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and possessed
           his land from Arnon unto Jabbok, even unto the children of
           Ammon: for the border of the children of Ammon was strong.

04:021:025 And Israel took all these cities: and Israel dwelt in all the
           cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all the villages
           thereof.

04:021:026 For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites,
           who had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all
           his land out of his hand, even unto Arnon.

04:021:027 Wherefore they that speak in proverbs say, Come into Heshbon,
           let the city of Sihon be built and prepared:

04:021:028 For there is a fire gone out of Heshbon, a flame from the city
           of Sihon: it hath consumed Ar of Moab, and the lords of the
           high places of Arnon.

04:021:029 Woe to thee, Moab! thou art undone, O people of Chemosh: he
           hath given his sons that escaped, and his daughters, into
           captivity unto Sihon king of the Amorites.

04:021:030 We have shot at them; Heshbon is perished even unto Dibon, and
           we have laid them waste even unto Nophah, which reacheth unto
           Medeba.

04:021:031 Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites.

04:021:032 And Moses sent to spy out Jaazer, and they took the villages
           thereof, and drove out the Amorites that were there.

04:021:033 And they turned and went up by the way of Bashan: and Og the
           king of Bashan went out against them, he, and all his people,
           to the battle at Edrei.

04:021:034 And the LORD said unto Moses, Fear him not: for I have
           delivered him into thy hand, and all his people, and his land;
           and thou shalt do to him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the
           Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon.

04:021:035 So they smote him, and his sons, and all his people, until
           there was none left him alive: and they possessed his land.

04:022:001 And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in the
           plains of Moab on this side Jordan by Jericho.

04:022:002 And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to
           the Amorites.

04:022:003 And Moab was sore afraid of the people, because they were
           many: and Moab was distressed because of the children of
           Israel.

04:022:004 And Moab said unto the elders of Midian, Now shall this
           company lick up all that are round about us, as the ox licketh
           up the grass of the field. And Balak the son of Zippor was
           king of the Moabites at that time.

04:022:005 He sent messengers therefore unto Balaam the son of Beor to
           Pethor, which is by the river of the land of the children of
           his people, to call him, saying, Behold, there is a people
           come out from Egypt: behold, they cover the face of the earth,
           and they abide over against me:

04:022:006 Come now therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people; for
           they are too mighty for me: peradventure I shall prevail, that
           we may smite them, and that I may drive them out of the land:
           for I wot that he whom thou blessest is blessed, and he whom
           thou cursest is cursed.

04:022:007 And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with
           the rewards of divination in their hand; and they came unto
           Balaam, and spake unto him the words of Balak.

04:022:008 And he said unto them, Lodge here this night, and I will bring
           you word again, as the LORD shall speak unto me: and the
           princes of Moab abode with Balaam.

04:022:009 And God came unto Balaam, and said, What men are these with
           thee?

04:022:010 And Balaam said unto God, Balak the son of Zippor, king of
           Moab, hath sent unto me, saying,

04:022:011 Behold, there is a people come out of Egypt, which covereth
           the face of the earth: come now, curse me them; peradventure I
           shall be able to overcome them, and drive them out.

04:022:012 And God said unto Balaam, Thou shalt not go with them; thou
           shalt not curse the people: for they are blessed.

04:022:013 And Balaam rose up in the morning, and said unto the princes
           of Balak, Get you into your land: for the LORD refuseth to
           give me leave to go with you.

04:022:014 And the princes of Moab rose up, and they went unto Balak, and
           said, Balaam refuseth to come with us.

04:022:015 And Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honourable
           than they.

04:022:016 And they came to Balaam, and said to him, Thus saith Balak the
           son of Zippor, Let nothing, I pray thee, hinder thee from
           coming unto me:

04:022:017 For I will promote thee unto very great honour, and I will do
           whatsoever thou sayest unto me: come therefore, I pray thee,
           curse me this people.

04:022:018 And Balaam answered and said unto the servants of Balak, If
           Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I
           cannot go beyond the word of the LORD my God, to do less or
           more.

04:022:019 Now therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night, that
           I may know what the LORD will say unto me more.

04:022:020 And God came unto Balaam at night, and said unto him, If the
           men come to call thee, rise up, and go with them; but yet the
           word which I shall say unto thee, that shalt thou do.

04:022:021 And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and
           went with the princes of Moab.

04:022:022 And God's anger was kindled because he went: and the angel of
           the LORD stood in the way for an adversary against him. Now he
           was riding upon his ass, and his two servants were with him.

04:022:023 And the ass saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and
           his sword drawn in his hand: and the ass turned aside out of
           the way, and went into the field: and Balaam smote the ass, to
           turn her into the way.

04:022:024 But the angel of the LORD stood in a path of the vineyards, a
           wall being on this side, and a wall on that side.

04:022:025 And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she thrust herself
           unto the wall, and crushed Balaam's foot against the wall: and
           he smote her again.

04:022:026 And the angel of the LORD went further, and stood in a narrow
           place, where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to
           the left.

04:022:027 And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she fell down
           under Balaam: and Balaam's anger was kindled, and he smote the
           ass with a staff.

04:022:028 And the LORD opened the mouth of the ass, and she said unto
           Balaam, What have I done unto thee, that thou hast smitten me
           these three times?

04:022:029 And Balaam said unto the ass, Because thou hast mocked me: I
           would there were a sword in mine hand, for now would I kill
           thee.

04:022:030 And the ass said unto Balaam, Am not I thine ass, upon which
           thou hast ridden ever since I was thine unto this day? was I
           ever wont to do so unto thee? And he said, Nay.

04:022:031 Then the LORD opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel
           of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his
           hand: and he bowed down his head, and fell flat on his face.

04:022:032 And the angel of the LORD said unto him, Wherefore hast thou
           smitten thine ass these three times? behold, I went out to
           withstand thee, because thy way is perverse before me:

04:022:033 And the ass saw me, and turned from me these three times:
           unless she had turned from me, surely now also I had slain
           thee, and saved her alive.

04:022:034 And Balaam said unto the angel of the LORD, I have sinned; for
           I knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me: now
           therefore, if it displease thee, I will get me back again.

04:022:035 And the angel of the LORD said unto Balaam, Go with the men:
           but only the word that I shall speak unto thee, that thou
           shalt speak. So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.

04:022:036 And when Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meet
           him unto a city of Moab, which is in the border of Arnon,
           which is in the utmost coast.

04:022:037 And Balak said unto Balaam, Did I not earnestly send unto thee
           to call thee? wherefore camest thou not unto me? am I not able
           indeed to promote thee to honour?

04:022:038 And Balaam said unto Balak, Lo, I am come unto thee: have I
           now any power at all to say any thing? the word that God
           putteth in my mouth, that shall I speak.

04:022:039 And Balaam went with Balak, and they came unto Kirjathhuzoth.

04:022:040 And Balak offered oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to
           the princes that were with him.

04:022:041 And it came to pass on the morrow, that Balak took Balaam, and
           brought him up into the high places of Baal, that thence he
           might see the utmost part of the people.

04:023:001 And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and
           prepare me here seven oxen and seven rams.

04:023:002 And Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and Balak and Balaam
           offered on every altar a bullock and a ram.

04:023:003 And Balaam said unto Balak, Stand by thy burnt offering, and I
           will go: peradventure the LORD will come to meet me: and
           whatsoever he sheweth me I will tell thee. And he went to an
           high place.

04:023:004 And God met Balaam: and he said unto him, I have prepared
           seven altars, and I have offered upon every altar a bullock
           and a ram.

04:023:005 And the LORD put a word in Balaam's mouth, and said, Return
           unto Balak, and thus thou shalt speak.

04:023:006 And he returned unto him, and, lo, he stood by his burnt
           sacrifice, he, and all the princes of Moab.

04:023:007 And he took up his parable, and said, Balak the king of Moab
           hath brought me from Aram, out of the mountains of the east,
           saying, Come, curse me Jacob, and come, defy Israel.

04:023:008 How shall I curse, whom God hath not cursed? or how shall I
           defy, whom the LORD hath not defied?

04:023:009 For from the top of the rocks I see him, and from the hills I
           behold him: lo, the people shall dwell alone, and shall not be
           reckoned among the nations.

04:023:010 Who can count the dust of Jacob, and the number of the fourth
           part of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous, and let
           my last end be like his!

04:023:011 And Balak said unto Balaam, What hast thou done unto me? I
           took thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast
           blessed them altogether.

04:023:012 And he answered and said, Must I not take heed to speak that
           which the LORD hath put in my mouth?

04:023:013 And Balak said unto him, Come, I pray thee, with me unto
           another place, from whence thou mayest see them: thou shalt
           see but the utmost part of them, and shalt not see them all:
           and curse me them from thence.

04:023:014 And he brought him into the field of Zophim, to the top of
           Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered a bullock and a
           ram on every altar.

04:023:015 And he said unto Balak, Stand here by thy burnt offering,
           while I meet the LORD yonder.

04:023:016 And the LORD met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and
           said, Go again unto Balak, and say thus.

04:023:017 And when he came to him, behold, he stood by his burnt
           offering, and the princes of Moab with him. And Balak said
           unto him, What hath the LORD spoken?

04:023:018 And he took up his parable, and said, Rise up, Balak, and
           hear; hearken unto me, thou son of Zippor:

04:023:019 God is not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man,
           that he should repent: hath he said, and shall he not do it?
           or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good?

04:023:020 Behold, I have received commandment to bless: and he hath
           blessed; and I cannot reverse it.

04:023:021 He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither hath he seen
           perverseness in Israel: the LORD his God is with him, and the
           shout of a king is among them.

04:023:022 God brought them out of Egypt; he hath as it were the strength
           of an unicorn.

04:023:023 Surely there is no enchantment against Jacob, neither is there
           any divination against Israel: according to this time it shall
           be said of Jacob and of Israel, What hath God wrought!

04:023:024 Behold, the people shall rise up as a great lion, and lift up
           himself as a young lion: he shall not lie down until he eat of
           the prey, and drink the blood of the slain.

04:023:025 And Balak said unto Balaam, Neither curse them at all, nor
           bless them at all.

04:023:026 But Balaam answered and said unto Balak, Told not I thee,
           saying, All that the LORD speaketh, that I must do?

04:023:027 And Balak said unto Balaam, Come, I pray thee, I will bring
           thee unto another place; peradventure it will please God that
           thou mayest curse me them from thence.

04:023:028 And Balak brought Balaam unto the top of Peor, that looketh
           toward Jeshimon.

04:023:029 And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and
           prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams.

04:023:030 And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered a bullock and a
           ram on every altar.

04:024:001 And when Balaam saw that it pleased the LORD to bless Israel,
           he went not, as at other times, to seek for enchantments, but
           he set his face toward the wilderness.

04:024:002 And Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel abiding in
           his tents according to their tribes; and the spirit of God
           came upon him.

04:024:003 And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor
           hath said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said:

04:024:004 He hath said, which heard the words of God, which saw the
           vision of the Almighty, falling into a trance, but having his
           eyes open:

04:024:005 How goodly are thy tents, O Jacob, and thy tabernacles, O
           Israel!

04:024:006 As the valleys are they spread forth, as gardens by the
           river's side, as the trees of lign aloes which the LORD hath
           planted, and as cedar trees beside the waters.

04:024:007 He shall pour the water out of his buckets, and his seed shall
           be in many waters, and his king shall be higher than Agag, and
           his kingdom shall be exalted.

04:024:008 God brought him forth out of Egypt; he hath as it were the
           strength of an unicorn: he shall eat up the nations his
           enemies, and shall break their bones, and pierce them through
           with his arrows.

04:024:009 He couched, he lay down as a lion, and as a great lion: who
           shall stir him up? Blessed is he that blesseth thee, and
           cursed is he that curseth thee.

04:024:010 And Balak's anger was kindled against Balaam, and he smote his
           hands together: and Balak said unto Balaam, I called thee to
           curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast altogether blessed
           them these three times.

04:024:011 Therefore now flee thou to thy place: I thought to promote
           thee unto great honour; but, lo, the LORD hath kept thee back
           from honour.

04:024:012 And Balaam said unto Balak, Spake I not also to thy messengers
           which thou sentest unto me, saying,

04:024:013 If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I
           cannot go beyond the commandment of the LORD, to do either
           good or bad of mine own mind; but what the LORD saith, that
           will I speak?

04:024:014 And now, behold, I go unto my people: come therefore, and I
           will advertise thee what this people shall do to thy people in
           the latter days.

04:024:015 And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor
           hath said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said:

04:024:016 He hath said, which heard the words of God, and knew the
           knowledge of the most High, which saw the vision of the
           Almighty, falling into a trance, but having his eyes open:

04:024:017 I shall see him, but not now: I shall behold him, but not
           nigh: there shall come a Star out of Jacob, and a Sceptre
           shall rise out of Israel, and shall smite the corners of Moab,
           and destroy all the children of Sheth.

04:024:018 And Edom shall be a possession, Seir also shall be a
           possession for his enemies; and Israel shall do valiantly.

04:024:019 Out of Jacob shall come he that shall have dominion, and shall
           destroy him that remaineth of the city.

04:024:020 And when he looked on Amalek, he took up his parable, and
           said, Amalek was the first of the nations; but his latter end
           shall be that he perish for ever.

04:024:021 And he looked on the Kenites, and took up his parable, and
           said, Strong is thy dwellingplace, and thou puttest thy nest
           in a rock.

04:024:022 Nevertheless the Kenite shall be wasted, until Asshur shall
           carry thee away captive.

04:024:023 And he took up his parable, and said, Alas, who shall live
           when God doeth this!

04:024:024 And ships shall come from the coast of Chittim, and shall
           afflict Asshur, and shall afflict Eber, and he also shall
           perish for ever.

04:024:025 And Balaam rose up, and went and returned to his place: and
           Balak also went his way.

04:025:001 And Israel abode in Shittim, and the people began to commit
           whoredom with the daughters of Moab.

04:025:002 And they called the people unto the sacrifices of their gods:
           and the people did eat, and bowed down to their gods.

04:025:003 And Israel joined himself unto Baalpeor: and the anger of the
           LORD was kindled against Israel.

04:025:004 And the LORD said unto Moses, Take all the heads of the
           people, and hang them up before the LORD against the sun, that
           the fierce anger of the LORD may be turned away from Israel.

04:025:005 And Moses said unto the judges of Israel, Slay ye every one
           his men that were joined unto Baalpeor.

04:025:006 And, behold, one of the children of Israel came and brought
           unto his brethren a Midianitish woman in the sight of Moses,
           and in the sight of all the congregation of the children of
           Israel, who were weeping before the door of the tabernacle of
           the congregation.

04:025:007 And when Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the
           priest, saw it, he rose up from among the congregation, and
           took a javelin in his hand;

04:025:008 And he went after the man of Israel into the tent, and thrust
           both of them through, the man of Israel, and the woman through
           her belly. So the plague was stayed from the children of
           Israel.

04:025:009 And those that died in the plague were twenty and four
           thousand.

04:025:010 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

04:025:011 Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest,
           hath turned my wrath away from the children of Israel, while
           he was zealous for my sake among them, that I consumed not the
           children of Israel in my jealousy.

04:025:012 Wherefore say, Behold, I give unto him my covenant of peace:

04:025:013 And he shall have it, and his seed after him, even the
           covenant of an everlasting priesthood; because he was zealous
           for his God, and made an atonement for the children of Israel.

04:025:014 Now the name of the Israelite that was slain, even that was
           slain with the Midianitish woman, was Zimri, the son of Salu,
           a prince of a chief house among the Simeonites.

04:025:015 And the name of the Midianitish woman that was slain was
           Cozbi, the daughter of Zur; he was head over a people, and of
           a chief house in Midian.

04:025:016 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

04:025:017 Vex the Midianites, and smite them:

04:025:018 For they vex you with their wiles, wherewith they have
           beguiled you in the matter of Peor, and in the matter of
           Cozbi, the daughter of a prince of Midian, their sister, which
           was slain in the day of the plague for Peor's sake.

04:026:001 And it came to pass after the plague, that the LORD spake unto
           Moses and unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, saying,

04:026:002 Take the sum of all the congregation of the children of
           Israel, from twenty years old and upward, throughout their
           fathers' house, all that are able to go to war in Israel.

04:026:003 And Moses and Eleazar the priest spake with them in the plains
           of Moab by Jordan near Jericho, saying,

04:026:004 Take the sum of the people, from twenty years old and upward;
           as the LORD commanded Moses and the children of Israel, which
           went forth out of the land of Egypt.

04:026:005 Reuben, the eldest son of Israel: the children of Reuben;
           Hanoch, of whom cometh the family of the Hanochites: of Pallu,
           the family of the Palluites:

           of the Carmites.

04:026:007 These are the families of the Reubenites: and they that were
           numbered of them were forty and three thousand and seven
           hundred and thirty.

04:026:008 And the sons of Pallu; Eliab.

04:026:009 And the sons of Eliab; Nemuel, and Dathan, and Abiram. This is
           that Dathan and Abiram, which were famous in the congregation,
           who strove against Moses and against Aaron in the company of
           Korah, when they strove against the LORD:

04:026:010 And the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up together
           with Korah, when that company died, what time the fire
           devoured two hundred and fifty men: and they became a sign.

04:026:011 Notwithstanding the children of Korah died not.

           Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.

04:026:052 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

04:026:053 Unto these the land shall be divided for an inheritance
           according to the number of names.

04:026:054 To many thou shalt give the more inheritance, and to few thou
           shalt give the less inheritance: to every one shall his
           inheritance be given according to those that were numbered of
           him.

04:026:055 Notwithstanding the land shall be divided by lot: according to
           the names of the tribes of their fathers they shall inherit.

04:026:056 According to the lot shall the possession thereof be divided
           between many and few.

04:026:059 And the name of Amram's wife was Jochebed, the daughter of
           Levi, whom her mother bare to Levi in Egypt: and she bare unto
           Amram Aaron and Moses, and Miriam their sister.

04:026:060 And unto Aaron was born Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and
           Ithamar.

04:026:061 And Nadab and Abihu died, when they offered strange fire
           before the LORD.

04:026:062 And those that were numbered of them were twenty and three
           thousand, all males from a month old and upward: for they were
           not numbered among the children of Israel, because there was
           no inheritance given them among the children of Israel.

04:026:063 These are they that were numbered by Moses and Eleazar the
           priest, who numbered the children of Israel in the plains of
           Moab by Jordan near Jericho.

04:026:064 But among these there was not a man of them whom Moses and
           Aaron the priest numbered, when they numbered the children of
           Israel in the wilderness of Sinai.

04:026:065 For the LORD had said of them, They shall surely die in the
           wilderness. And there was not left a man of them, save Caleb
           the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.

04:027:001 Then came the daughters of Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the
           son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the
           families of Manasseh the son of Joseph: and these are the
           names of his daughters; Mahlah, Noah, and Hoglah, and Milcah,
           and Tirzah.

04:027:002 And they stood before Moses, and before Eleazar the priest,
           and before the princes and all the congregation, by the door
           of the tabernacle of the congregation, saying,

04:027:003 Our father died in the wilderness, and he was not in the
           company of them that gathered themselves together against the
           LORD in the company of Korah; but died in his own sin, and had
           no sons.

04:027:004 Why should the name of our father be done away from among his
           family, because he hath no son? Give unto us therefore a
           possession among the brethren of our father.

04:027:005 And Moses brought their cause before the LORD.

04:027:006 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

04:027:007 The daughters of Zelophehad speak right: thou shalt surely
           give them a possession of an inheritance among their father's
           brethren; and thou shalt cause the inheritance of their father
           to pass unto them.

04:027:008 And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a
           man die, and have no son, then ye shall cause his inheritance
           to pass unto his daughter.

04:027:009 And if he have no daughter, then ye shall give his inheritance
           unto his brethren.

04:027:010 And if he have no brethren, then ye shall give his inheritance
           unto his father's brethren.

04:027:011 And if his father have no brethren, then ye shall give his
           inheritance unto his kinsman that is next to him of his
           family, and he shall possess it: and it shall be unto the
           children of Israel a statute of judgment, as the LORD
           commanded Moses.

04:027:012 And the LORD said unto Moses, Get thee up into this mount
           Abarim, and see the land which I have given unto the children
           of Israel.

04:027:013 And when thou hast seen it, thou also shalt be gathered unto
           thy people, as Aaron thy brother was gathered.

04:027:014 For ye rebelled against my commandment in the desert of Zin,
           in the strife of the congregation, to sanctify me at the water
           before their eyes: that is the water of Meribah in Kadesh in
           the wilderness of Zin.

04:027:015 And Moses spake unto the LORD, saying,

04:027:016 Let the LORD, the God of the spirits of all flesh, set a man
           over the congregation,

04:027:017 Which may go out before them, and which may go in before them,
           and which may lead them out, and which may bring them in; that
           the congregation of the LORD be not as sheep which have no
           shepherd.

04:027:018 And the LORD said unto Moses, Take thee Joshua the son of Nun,
           a man in whom is the spirit, and lay thine hand upon him;

04:027:019 And set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the
           congregation; and give him a charge in their sight.

04:027:020 And thou shalt put some of thine honour upon him, that all the
           congregation of the children of Israel may be obedient.

04:027:021 And he shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who shall ask
           counsel for him after the judgment of Urim before the LORD: at
           his word shall they go out, and at his word they shall come
           in, both he, and all the children of Israel with him, even all
           the congregation.

04:027:022 And Moses did as the LORD commanded him: and he took Joshua,
           and set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the
           congregation:

04:027:023 And he laid his hands upon him, and gave him a charge, as the
           LORD commanded by the hand of Moses.

04:028:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

04:028:002 Command the children of Israel, and say unto them, My
           offering, and my bread for my sacrifices made by fire, for a
           sweet savour unto me, shall ye observe to offer unto me in
           their due season.

04:028:003 And thou shalt say unto them, This is the offering made by
           fire which ye shall offer unto the LORD; two lambs of the
           first year without spot day by day, for a continual burnt
           offering.

04:028:004 The one lamb shalt thou offer in the morning, and the other
           lamb shalt thou offer at even;

04:028:005 And a tenth part of an ephah of flour for a meat offering,
           mingled with the fourth part of an hin of beaten oil.

04:028:006 It is a continual burnt offering, which was ordained in mount
           Sinai for a sweet savour, a sacrifice made by fire unto the
           LORD.

04:028:007 And the drink offering thereof shall be the fourth part of an
           hin for the one lamb: in the holy place shalt thou cause the
           strong wine to be poured unto the LORD for a drink offering.

04:028:008 And the other lamb shalt thou offer at even: as the meat
           offering of the morning, and as the drink offering thereof,
           thou shalt offer it, a sacrifice made by fire, of a sweet
           savour unto the LORD.

04:028:009 And on the sabbath day two lambs of the first year without
           spot, and two tenth deals of flour for a meat offering,
           mingled with oil, and the drink offering thereof:

04:028:010 This is the burnt offering of every sabbath, beside the
           continual burnt offering, and his drink offering.

04:028:011 And in the beginnings of your months ye shall offer a burnt
           offering unto the LORD; two young bullocks, and one ram, seven
           lambs of the first year without spot;

04:028:012 And three tenth deals of flour for a meat offering, mingled
           with oil, for one bullock; and two tenth deals of flour for a
           meat offering, mingled with oil, for one ram;

04:028:013 And a several tenth deal of flour mingled with oil for a meat
           offering unto one lamb; for a burnt offering of a sweet
           savour, a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD.

04:028:014 And their drink offerings shall be half an hin of wine unto a
           bullock, and the third part of an hin unto a ram, and a fourth
           part of an hin unto a lamb: this is the burnt offering of
           every month throughout the months of the year.

04:028:015 And one kid of the goats for a sin offering unto the LORD
           shall be offered, beside the continual burnt offering, and his
           drink offering.

04:028:016 And in the fourteenth day of the first month is the passover
           of the LORD.

04:028:017 And in the fifteenth day of this month is the feast: seven
           days shall unleavened bread be eaten.

04:028:018 In the first day shall be an holy convocation; ye shall do no
           manner of servile work therein:

04:028:019 But ye shall offer a sacrifice made by fire for a burnt
           offering unto the LORD; two young bullocks, and one ram, and
           seven lambs of the first year: they shall be unto you without
           blemish:

04:028:020 And their meat offering shall be of flour mingled with oil:
           three tenth deals shall ye offer for a bullock, and two tenth
           deals for a ram;

04:028:021 A several tenth deal shalt thou offer for every lamb,
           throughout the seven lambs:

04:028:022 And one goat for a sin offering, to make an atonement for you.

04:028:023 Ye shall offer these beside the burnt offering in the morning,
           which is for a continual burnt offering.

04:028:024 After this manner ye shall offer daily, throughout the seven
           days, the meat of the sacrifice made by fire, of a sweet
           savour unto the LORD: it shall be offered beside the continual
           burnt offering, and his drink offering.

04:028:025 And on the seventh day ye shall have an holy convocation; ye
           shall do no servile work.

04:028:026 Also in the day of the firstfruits, when ye bring a new meat
           offering unto the LORD, after your weeks be out, ye shall have
           an holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work:

04:028:027 But ye shall offer the burnt offering for a sweet savour unto
           the LORD; two young bullocks, one ram, seven lambs of the
           first year;

04:028:028 And their meat offering of flour mingled with oil, three tenth
           deals unto one bullock, two tenth deals unto one ram,

04:028:029 A several tenth deal unto one lamb, throughout the seven
           lambs;

04:028:030 And one kid of the goats, to make an atonement for you.

04:028:031 Ye shall offer them beside the continual burnt offering, and
           his meat offering, (they shall be unto you without blemish)
           and their drink offerings.

04:029:001 And in the seventh month, on the first day of the month, ye
           shall have an holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work:
           it is a day of blowing the trumpets unto you.

04:029:002 And ye shall offer a burnt offering for a sweet savour unto
           the LORD; one young bullock, one ram, and seven lambs of the
           first year without blemish:

04:029:003 And their meat offering shall be of flour mingled with oil,
           three tenth deals for a bullock, and two tenth deals for a
           ram,

04:029:004 And one tenth deal for one lamb, throughout the seven lambs:

04:029:005 And one kid of the goats for a sin offering, to make an
           atonement for you:

04:029:006 Beside the burnt offering of the month, and his meat offering,
           and the daily burnt offering, and his meat offering, and their
           drink offerings, according unto their manner, for a sweet
           savour, a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD.

04:029:007 And ye shall have on the tenth day of this seventh month an
           holy convocation; and ye shall afflict your souls: ye shall
           not do any work therein:

04:029:008 But ye shall offer a burnt offering unto the LORD for a sweet
           savour; one young bullock, one ram, and seven lambs of the
           first year; they shall be unto you without blemish:

04:029:009 And their meat offering shall be of flour mingled with oil,
           three tenth deals to a bullock, and two tenth deals to one
           ram,

04:029:010 A several tenth deal for one lamb, throughout the seven lambs:

04:029:011 One kid of the goats for a sin offering; beside the sin
           offering of atonement, and the continual burnt offering, and
           the meat offering of it, and their drink offerings.

04:029:012 And on the fifteenth day of the seventh month ye shall have an
           holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work, and ye shall
           keep a feast unto the LORD seven days:

04:029:013 And ye shall offer a burnt offering, a sacrifice made by fire,
           of a sweet savour unto the LORD; thirteen young bullocks, two
           rams, and fourteen lambs of the first year; they shall be
           without blemish:

04:029:014 And their meat offering shall be of flour mingled with oil,
           three tenth deals unto every bullock of the thirteen bullocks,
           two tenth deals to each ram of the two rams,

04:029:015 And a several tenth deal to each lamb of the fourteen lambs:

04:029:016 And one kid of the goats for a sin offering; beside the
           continual burnt offering, his meat offering, and his drink
           offering.

04:029:017 And on the second day ye shall offer twelve young bullocks,
           two rams, fourteen lambs of the first year without spot:

04:029:018 And their meat offering and their drink offerings for the
           bullocks, for the rams, and for the lambs, shall be according
           to their number, after the manner:

04:029:019 And one kid of the goats for a sin offering; beside the
           continual burnt offering, and the meat offering thereof, and
           their drink offerings.

04:029:020 And on the third day eleven bullocks, two rams, fourteen lambs
           of the first year without blemish;

04:029:021 And their meat offering and their drink offerings for the
           bullocks, for the rams, and for the lambs, shall be according
           to their number, after the manner:

04:029:022 And one goat for a sin offering; beside the continual burnt
           offering, and his meat offering, and his drink offering.

04:029:023 And on the fourth day ten bullocks, two rams, and fourteen
           lambs of the first year without blemish:

04:029:024 Their meat offering and their drink offerings for the
           bullocks, for the rams, and for the lambs, shall be according
           to their number, after the manner:

04:029:025 And one kid of the goats for a sin offering; beside the
           continual burnt offering, his meat offering, and his drink
           offering.

04:029:026 And on the fifth day nine bullocks, two rams, and fourteen
           lambs of the first year without spot:

04:029:027 And their meat offering and their drink offerings for the
           bullocks, for the rams, and for the lambs, shall be according

04:029:029 And on the sixth day eight bullocks, two rams, and fourteen
           lambs of the first year without blemish:

04:029:030 And their meat offering and their drink offerings for the
           bullocks, for the rams, and for the lambs, shall be according
           to their number, after the manner:

04:029:033 And their meat offering and their drink offerings for the

           to their number, after the manner:

04:029:034 And one goat for a sin offering; beside the continual burnt

04:029:035 On the eighth day ye shall have a solemn assembly: ye shall do
           no servile work therein:

04:029:036 But ye shall offer a burnt offering, a sacrifice made by fire,
           of a sweet savour unto the LORD: one bullock, one ram, seven
           lambs of the first year without blemish:

04:029:037 Their meat offering and their drink offerings for the bullock,
           for the ram, and for the lambs, shall be according to their
           number, after the manner:

04:029:038 And one goat for a sin offering; beside the continual burnt

04:029:039 These things ye shall do unto the LORD in your set feasts,
           beside your vows, and your freewill offerings, for your burnt
           offerings, and for your meat offerings, and for your drink
           offerings, and for your peace offerings.

04:029:040 And Moses told the children of Israel according to all that
           the LORD commanded Moses.

04:030:001 And Moses spake unto the heads of the tribes concerning the
           children of Israel, saying, This is the thing which the LORD
           hath commanded.

04:030:002 If a man vow a vow unto the LORD, or swear an oath to bind his
           soul with a bond; he shall not break his word, he shall do
           according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth.

04:030:003 If a woman also vow a vow unto the LORD, and bind herself by a
           bond, being in her father's house in her youth;

04:030:004 And her father hear her vow, and her bond wherewith she hath
           bound her soul, and her father shall hold his peace at her;
           then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she
           hath bound her soul shall stand.

04:030:005 But if her father disallow her in the day that he heareth; not
           any of her vows, or of her bonds wherewith she hath bound her
           soul, shall stand: and the LORD shall forgive her, because her
           father disallowed her.

04:030:006 And if she had at all an husband, when she vowed, or uttered
           ought out of her lips, wherewith she bound her soul;

04:030:007 And her husband heard it, and held his peace at her in the day
           that he heard it: then her vows shall stand, and her bonds
           wherewith she bound her soul shall stand.

04:030:008 But if her husband disallowed her on the day that he heard it;
           then he shall make her vow which she vowed, and that which she
           uttered with her lips, wherewith she bound her soul, of none
           effect: and the LORD shall forgive her.

04:030:009 But every vow of a widow, and of her that is divorced,
           wherewith they have bound their souls, shall stand against
           her.

04:030:010 And if she vowed in her husband's house, or bound her soul by
           a bond with an oath;

04:030:011 And her husband heard it, and held his peace at her, and
           disallowed her not: then all her vows shall stand, and every
           bond wherewith she bound her soul shall stand.

04:030:012 But if her husband hath utterly made them void on the day he
           heard them; then whatsoever proceeded out of her lips
           concerning her vows, or concerning the bond of her soul, shall
           not stand: her husband hath made them void; and the LORD shall
           forgive her.

04:030:013 Every vow, and every binding oath to afflict the soul, her
           husband may establish it, or her husband may make it void.

04:030:014 But if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day
           to day; then he establisheth all her vows, or all her bonds,
           which are upon her: he confirmeth them, because he held his
           peace at her in the day that he heard them.

04:030:015 But if he shall any ways make them void after that he hath
           heard them; then he shall bear her iniquity.

04:030:016 These are the statutes, which the LORD commanded Moses,
           between a man and his wife, between the father and his
           daughter, being yet in her youth in her father's house.

04:031:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

04:031:002 Avenge the children of Israel of the Midianites: afterward
           shalt thou be gathered unto thy people.

04:031:003 And Moses spake unto the people, saying, Arm some of
           yourselves unto the war, and let them go against the
           Midianites, and avenge the LORD of Midian.

04:031:004 Of every tribe a thousand, throughout all the tribes of
           Israel, shall ye send to the war.

04:031:005 So there were delivered out of the thousands of Israel, a
           thousand of every tribe, twelve thousand armed for war.

04:031:006 And Moses sent them to the war, a thousand of every tribe,
           them and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, to the war,
           with the holy instruments, and the trumpets to blow in his
           hand.

04:031:007 And they warred against the Midianites, as the LORD commanded
           Moses; and they slew all the males.

04:031:008 And they slew the kings of Midian, beside the rest of them
           that were slain; namely, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and
           Reba, five kings of Midian: Balaam also the son of Beor they
           slew with the sword.

04:031:009 And the children of Israel took all the women of Midian
           captives, and their little ones, and took the spoil of all
           their cattle, and all their flocks, and all their goods.

04:031:010 And they burnt all their cities wherein they dwelt, and all
           their goodly castles, with fire.

04:031:011 And they took all the spoil, and all the prey, both of men and
           of beasts.

04:031:012 And they brought the captives, and the prey, and the spoil,
           unto Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and unto the congregation
           of the children of Israel, unto the camp at the plains of
           Moab, which are by Jordan near Jericho.

04:031:013 And Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and all the princes of the
           congregation, went forth to meet them without the camp.

04:031:014 And Moses was wroth with the officers of the host, with the
           captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, which
           came from the battle.

04:031:015 And Moses said unto them, Have ye saved all the women alive?

04:031:016 Behold, these caused the children of Israel, through the
           counsel of Balaam, to commit trespass against the LORD in the
           matter of Peor, and there was a plague among the congregation
           of the LORD.

04:031:017 Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill
           every woman that hath known man by lying with him.

04:031:018 But all the women children, that have not known a man by lying
           with him, keep alive for yourselves.

04:031:019 And do ye abide without the camp seven days: whosoever hath
           killed any person, and whosoever hath touched any slain,
           purify both yourselves and your captives on the third day, and
           on the seventh day.

04:031:020 And purify all your raiment, and all that is made of skins,
           and all work of goats' hair, and all things made of wood.

04:031:021 And Eleazar the priest said unto the men of war which went to
           the battle, This is the ordinance of the law which the LORD
           commanded Moses;

04:031:022 Only the gold, and the silver, the brass, the iron, the tin,
           and the lead,

04:031:023 Every thing that may abide the fire, ye shall make it go
           through the fire, and it shall be clean: nevertheless it shall
           be purified with the water of separation: and all that abideth
           not the fire ye shall make go through the water.

04:031:024 And ye shall wash your clothes on the seventh day, and ye
           shall be clean, and afterward ye shall come into the camp.

04:031:025 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

04:031:026 Take the sum of the prey that was taken, both of man and of
           beast, thou, and Eleazar the priest, and the chief fathers of
           the congregation:

04:031:027 And divide the prey into two parts; between them that took the
           war upon them, who went out to battle, and between all the
           congregation:

04:031:028 And levy a tribute unto the LORD of the men of war which went
           out to battle: one soul of five hundred, both of the persons,
           and of the beeves, and of the asses, and of the sheep:

04:031:029 Take it of their half, and give it unto Eleazar the priest,
           for an heave offering of the LORD.

04:031:030 And of the children of Israel's half, thou shalt take one
           portion of fifty, of the persons, of the beeves, of the asses,
           and of the flocks, of all manner of beasts, and give them unto
           the Levites, which keep the charge of the tabernacle of the
           LORD.

04:031:031 And Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the LORD commanded
           Moses.

04:031:032 And the booty, being the rest of the prey which the men of war
           had caught, was six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and
           five thousand sheep,

04:031:033 And threescore and twelve thousand beeves,

04:031:034 And threescore and one thousand asses,

04:031:035 And thirty and two thousand persons in all, of women that had
           not known man by lying with him.

04:031:036 And the half, which was the portion of them that went out to
           war, was in number three hundred thousand and seven and thirty
           thousand and five hundred sheep:

04:031:037 And the LORD's tribute of the sheep was six hundred and
           threescore and fifteen.

04:031:038 And the beeves were thirty and six thousand; of which the
           LORD's tribute was threescore and twelve.

04:031:039 And the asses were thirty thousand and five hundred; of which
           the LORD's tribute was threescore and one.

04:031:040 And the persons were sixteen thousand; of which the LORD's
           tribute was thirty and two persons.

04:031:041 And Moses gave the tribute, which was the LORD's heave
           offering, unto Eleazar the priest, as the LORD commanded
           Moses.

04:031:042 And of the children of Israel's half, which Moses divided from
           the men that warred,

04:031:043 (Now the half that pertained unto the congregation was three
           hundred thousand and thirty thousand and seven thousand and
           five hundred sheep,

04:031:044 And thirty and six thousand beeves,

04:031:045 And thirty thousand asses and five hundred,

04:031:046 And sixteen thousand persons;)

04:031:047 Even of the children of Israel's half, Moses took one portion
           of fifty, both of man and of beast, and gave them unto the
           Levites, which kept the charge of the tabernacle of the LORD;
           as the LORD commanded Moses.

04:031:048 And the officers which were over thousands of the host, the
           captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, came near
           unto Moses:

04:031:049 And they said unto Moses, Thy servants have taken the sum of
           the men of war which are under our charge, and there lacketh
           not one man of us.

04:031:050 We have therefore brought an oblation for the LORD, what every
           man hath gotten, of jewels of gold, chains, and bracelets,
           rings, earrings, and tablets, to make an atonement for our
           souls before the LORD.

04:031:051 And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of them, even
           all wrought jewels.

04:031:052 And all the gold of the offering that they offered up to the
           LORD, of the captains of thousands, and of the captains of
           hundreds, was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty
           shekels.

04:031:053 (For the men of war had taken spoil, every man for himself.)

04:031:054 And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains
           of thousands and of hundreds, and brought it into the
           tabernacle of the congregation, for a memorial for the
           children of Israel before the LORD.

04:032:001 Now the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had a very
           great multitude of cattle: and when they saw the land of
           Jazer, and the land of Gilead, that, behold, the place was a
           place for cattle;

04:032:002 The children of Gad and the children of Reuben came and spake
           unto Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and unto the princes of
           the congregation, saying,

04:032:003 Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nimrah, and Heshbon, and
           Elealeh, and Shebam, and Nebo, and Beon,

04:032:004 Even the country which the LORD smote before the congregation
           of Israel, is a land for cattle, and thy servants have cattle:

04:032:005 Wherefore, said they, if we have found grace in thy sight, let
           this land be given unto thy servants for a possession, and
           bring us not over Jordan.

04:032:006 And Moses said unto the children of Gad and to the children of
           Reuben, Shall your brethren go to war, and shall ye sit here?

04:032:007 And wherefore discourage ye the heart of the children of
           Israel from going over into the land which the LORD hath given
           them?

04:032:008 Thus did your fathers, when I sent them from Kadeshbarnea to
           see the land.

04:032:009 For when they went up unto the valley of Eshcol, and saw the
           land, they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel,
           that they should not go into the land which the LORD had given
           them.

04:032:010 And the LORD's anger was kindled the same time, and he sware,
           saying,

04:032:011 Surely none of the men that came up out of Egypt, from twenty
           years old and upward, shall see the land which I sware unto
           Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob; because they have not
           wholly followed me:

04:032:012 Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite, and Joshua the
           son of Nun: for they have wholly followed the LORD.

04:032:013 And the LORD's anger was kindled against Israel, and he made
           them wander in the wilderness forty years, until all the
           generation, that had done evil in the sight of the LORD, was
           consumed.

04:032:014 And, behold, ye are risen up in your fathers' stead, an
           increase of sinful men, to augment yet the fierce anger of the
           LORD toward Israel.

04:032:015 For if ye turn away from after him, he will yet again leave
           them in the wilderness; and ye shall destroy all this people.

04:032:016 And they came near unto him, and said, We will build
           sheepfolds here for our cattle, and cities for our little
           ones:

04:032:017 But we ourselves will go ready armed before the children of
           Israel, until we have brought them unto their place: and our
           little ones shall dwell in the fenced cities because of the
           inhabitants of the land.

04:032:018 We will not return unto our houses, until the children of
           Israel have inherited every man his inheritance.

04:032:019 For we will not inherit with them on yonder side Jordan, or
           forward; because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side
           Jordan eastward.

04:032:020 And Moses said unto them, If ye will do this thing, if ye will
           go armed before the LORD to war,

04:032:021 And will go all of you armed over Jordan before the LORD,
           until he hath driven out his enemies from before him,

04:032:022 And the land be subdued before the LORD: then afterward ye
           shall return, and be guiltless before the LORD, and before
           Israel; and this land shall be your possession before the
           LORD.

04:032:023 But if ye will not do so, behold, ye have sinned against the
           LORD: and be sure your sin will find you out.

04:032:024 Build you cities for your little ones, and folds for your
           sheep; and do that which hath proceeded out of your mouth.

04:032:025 And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben spake unto
           Moses, saying, Thy servants will do as my lord commandeth.

04:032:026 Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our cattle,
           shall be there in the cities of Gilead:

04:032:027 But thy servants will pass over, every man armed for war,
           before the Lord to battle, as my lord saith.

04:032:028 So concerning them Moses commanded Eleazar the priest, and
           Joshua the son of Nun, and the chief fathers of the tribes of
           the children of Israel:

04:032:029 And Moses said unto them, If the children of Gad and the
           children of Reuben will pass with you over Jordan, every man
           armed to battle, before the LORD, and the land shall be
           subdued before you; then ye shall give them the land of Gilead
           for a possession:

04:032:030 But if they will not pass over with you armed, they shall have
           possessions among you in the land of Canaan.

04:032:031 And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered,
           saying, As the LORD hath said unto thy servants, so will we
           do.

04:032:032 We will pass over armed before the LORD into the land of
           Canaan, that the possession of our inheritance on this side
           Jordan may be our's.

04:032:033 And Moses gave unto them, even to the children of Gad, and to
           the children of Reuben, and unto half the tribe of Manasseh
           the son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites,
           and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, the land, with the
           cities thereof in the coasts, even the cities of the country
           round about.

04:032:034 And the children of Gad built Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer,

04:032:035 And Atroth, Shophan, and Jaazer, and Jogbehah,

04:032:036 And Bethnimrah, and Bethharan, fenced cities: and folds for
           sheep.

04:032:037 And the children of Reuben built Heshbon, and Elealeh, and
           Kirjathaim,

04:032:038 And Nebo, and Baalmeon, (their names being changed,) and
           Shibmah: and gave other names unto the cities which they
           builded.

04:032:039 And the children of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead,
           and took it, and dispossessed the Amorite which was in it.

04:032:040 And Moses gave Gilead unto Machir the son of Manasseh; and he
           dwelt therein.

04:032:041 And Jair the son of Manasseh went and took the small towns
           thereof, and called them Havothjair.

04:032:042 And Nobah went and took Kenath, and the villages thereof, and
           called it Nobah, after his own name.

04:033:001 These are the journeys of the children of Israel, which went
           forth out of the land of Egypt with their armies under the
           hand of Moses and Aaron.

04:033:002 And Moses wrote their goings out according to their journeys
           by the commandment of the LORD: and these are their journeys
           according to their goings out.

04:033:003 And they departed from Rameses in the first month, on the
           fifteenth day of the first month; on the morrow after the
           passover the children of Israel went out with an high hand in
           the sight of all the Egyptians.

04:033:004 For the Egyptians buried all their firstborn, which the LORD
           had smitten among them: upon their gods also the LORD executed
           judgments.

04:033:005 And the children of Israel removed from Rameses, and pitched
           in Succoth.

04:033:006 And they departed from Succoth, and pitched in Etham, which is
           in the edge of the wilderness.

04:033:007 And they removed from Etham, and turned again unto Pihahiroth,
           which is before Baalzephon: and they pitched before Migdol.

04:033:008 And they departed from before Pihahiroth, and passed through
           the midst of the sea into the wilderness, and went three days'
           journey in the wilderness of Etham, and pitched in Marah.

04:033:009 And they removed from Marah, and came unto Elim: and in Elim
           were twelve fountains of water, and threescore and ten palm
           trees; and they pitched there.

04:033:010 And they removed from Elim, and encamped by the Red sea.

04:033:011 And they removed from the Red sea, and encamped in the
           wilderness of Sin.

04:033:012 And they took their journey out of the wilderness of Sin, and
           encamped in Dophkah.

04:033:013 And they departed from Dophkah, and encamped in Alush.

04:033:014 And they removed from Alush, and encamped at Rephidim, where
           was no water for the people to drink.

04:033:015 And they departed from Rephidim, and pitched in the wilderness
           of Sinai.

04:033:016 And they removed from the desert of Sinai, and pitched at
           Kibrothhattaavah.

04:033:017 And they departed from Kibrothhattaavah, and encamped at
           Hazeroth.

04:033:018 And they departed from Hazeroth, and pitched in Rithmah.

04:033:019 And they departed from Rithmah, and pitched at Rimmonparez.

04:033:020 And they departed from Rimmonparez, and pitched in Libnah.

04:033:021 And they removed from Libnah, and pitched at Rissah.

04:033:022 And they journeyed from Rissah, and pitched in Kehelathah.

04:033:023 And they went from Kehelathah, and pitched in mount Shapher.

04:033:024 And they removed from mount Shapher, and encamped in Haradah.

04:033:025 And they removed from Haradah, and pitched in Makheloth.

04:033:026 And they removed from Makheloth, and encamped at Tahath.

04:033:027 And they departed from Tahath, and pitched at Tarah.

04:033:028 And they removed from Tarah, and pitched in Mithcah.

04:033:029 And they went from Mithcah, and pitched in Hashmonah.

04:033:030 And they departed from Hashmonah, and encamped at Moseroth.

04:033:031 And they departed from Moseroth, and pitched in Benejaakan.

04:033:032 And they removed from Benejaakan, and encamped at Horhagidgad.

04:033:033 And they went from Horhagidgad, and pitched in Jotbathah.

04:033:034 And they removed from Jotbathah, and encamped at Ebronah.

04:033:035 And they departed from Ebronah, and encamped at Eziongaber.

04:033:036 And they removed from Eziongaber, and pitched in the
           wilderness of Zin, which is Kadesh.

04:033:037 And they removed from Kadesh, and pitched in mount Hor, in the
           edge of the land of Edom.

04:033:038 And Aaron the priest went up into mount Hor at the commandment
           of the LORD, and died there, in the fortieth year after the
           children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the
           first day of the fifth month.

04:033:039 And Aaron was an hundred and twenty and three years old when
           he died in mount Hor.

04:033:040 And king Arad the Canaanite, which dwelt in the south in the
           land of Canaan, heard of the coming of the children of Israel.

04:033:041 And they departed from mount Hor, and pitched in Zalmonah.

04:033:042 And they departed from Zalmonah, and pitched in Punon.

04:033:043 And they departed from Punon, and pitched in Oboth.

04:033:044 And they departed from Oboth, and pitched in Ijeabarim, in the
           border of Moab.

04:033:045 And they departed from Iim, and pitched in Dibongad.

04:033:046 And they removed from Dibongad, and encamped in
           Almondiblathaim.

04:033:047 And they removed from Almondiblathaim, and pitched in the
           mountains of Abarim, before Nebo.

04:033:048 And they departed from the mountains of Abarim, and pitched in
           the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho.

04:033:049 And they pitched by Jordan, from Bethjesimoth even unto
           Abelshittim in the plains of Moab.

04:033:050 And the LORD spake unto Moses in the plains of Moab by Jordan
           near Jericho, saying,

04:033:051 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye
           are passed over Jordan into the land of Canaan;

04:033:052 Then ye shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from
           before you, and destroy all their pictures, and destroy all
           their molten images, and quite pluck down all their high
           places:

04:033:053 And ye shall dispossess the inhabitants of the land, and dwell
           therein: for I have given you the land to possess it.

04:033:054 And ye shall divide the land by lot for an inheritance among
           your families: and to the more ye shall give the more
           inheritance, and to the fewer ye shall give the less
           inheritance: every man's inheritance shall be in the place
           where his lot falleth; according to the tribes of your fathers
           ye shall inherit.

04:033:055 But if ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from
           before you; then it shall come to pass, that those which ye
           let remain of them shall be pricks in your eyes, and thorns in
           your sides, and shall vex you in the land wherein ye dwell.

04:033:056 Moreover it shall come to pass, that I shall do unto you, as I
           thought to do unto them.

04:034:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

04:034:002 Command the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye
           come into the land of Canaan; (this is the land that shall
           fall unto you for an inheritance, even the land of Canaan with
           the coasts thereof:)

04:034:003 Then your south quarter shall be from the wilderness of Zin
           along by the coast of Edom, and your south border shall be the
           outmost coast of the salt sea eastward:

04:034:004 And your border shall turn from the south to the ascent of
           Akrabbim, and pass on to Zin: and the going forth thereof
           shall be from the south to Kadeshbarnea, and shall go on to
           Hazaraddar, and pass on to Azmon:

04:034:005 And the border shall fetch a compass from Azmon unto the river
           of Egypt, and the goings out of it shall be at the sea.

04:034:006 And as for the western border, ye shall even have the great
           sea for a border: this shall be your west border.

04:034:007 And this shall be your north border: from the great sea ye
           shall point out for you mount Hor:

04:034:008 From mount Hor ye shall point out your border unto the
           entrance of Hamath; and the goings forth of the border shall
           be to Zedad:

04:034:009 And the border shall go on to Ziphron, and the goings out of
           it shall be at Hazarenan: this shall be your north border.

04:034:010 And ye shall point out your east border from Hazarenan to
           Shepham:

04:034:011 And the coast shall go down from Shepham to Riblah, on the
           east side of Ain; and the border shall descend, and shall
           reach unto the side of the sea of Chinnereth eastward:

04:034:012 And the border shall go down to Jordan, and the goings out of
           it shall be at the salt sea: this shall be your land with the
           coasts thereof round about.

04:034:013 And Moses commanded the children of Israel, saying, This is
           the land which ye shall inherit by lot, which the LORD
           commanded to give unto the nine tribes, and to the half tribe:

04:034:014 For the tribe of the children of Reuben according to the house
           of their fathers, and the tribe of the children of Gad
           according to the house of their fathers, have received their
           inheritance; and half the tribe of Manasseh have received
           their inheritance:

04:034:015 The two tribes and the half tribe have received their
           inheritance on this side Jordan near Jericho eastward, toward
           the sunrising.

04:034:016 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

04:034:017 These are the names of the men which shall divide the land
           unto you: Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun.

04:034:018 And ye shall take one prince of every tribe, to divide the
           land by inheritance.

04:034:019 And the names of the men are these: Of the tribe of Judah,
           Caleb the son of Jephunneh.

04:034:020 And of the tribe of the children of Simeon, Shemuel the son of
           Ammihud.

04:034:021 Of the tribe of Benjamin, Elidad the son of Chislon.

04:034:022 And the prince of the tribe of the children of Dan, Bukki the
           son of Jogli.

04:034:023 The prince of the children of Joseph, for the tribe of the
           children of Manasseh, Hanniel the son of Ephod.

04:034:024 And the prince of the tribe of the children of Ephraim, Kemuel
           the son of Shiphtan.

04:034:025 And the prince of the tribe of the children of Zebulun,
           Elizaphan the son of Parnach.

04:034:026 And the prince of the tribe of the children of Issachar,
           Paltiel the son of Azzan.

04:034:027 And the prince of the tribe of the children of Asher, Ahihud
           the son of Shelomi.

04:034:028 And the prince of the tribe of the children of Naphtali,
           Pedahel the son of Ammihud.

04:034:029 These are they whom the LORD commanded to divide the
           inheritance unto the children of Israel in the land of Canaan.

04:035:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses in the plains of Moab by Jordan
           near Jericho, saying,

04:035:002 Command the children of Israel, that they give unto the
           Levites of the inheritance of their possession cities to dwell
           in; and ye shall give also unto the Levites suburbs for the
           cities round about them.

04:035:003 And the cities shall they have to dwell in; and the suburbs of
           them shall be for their cattle, and for their goods, and for
           all their beasts.

04:035:004 And the suburbs of the cities, which ye shall give unto the
           Levites, shall reach from the wall of the city and outward a
           thousand cubits round about.

04:035:005 And ye shall measure from without the city on the east side
           two thousand cubits, and on the south side two thousand
           cubits, and on the west side two thousand cubits, and on the
           north side two thousand cubits; and the city shall be in the
           midst: this shall be to them the suburbs of the cities.

04:035:006 And among the cities which ye shall give unto the Levites
           there shall be six cities for refuge, which ye shall appoint
           for the manslayer, that he may flee thither: and to them ye
           shall add forty and two cities.

04:035:007 So all the cities which ye shall give to the Levites shall be
           forty and eight cities: them shall ye give with their suburbs.

04:035:008 And the cities which ye shall give shall be of the possession
           of the children of Israel: from them that have many ye shall
           give many; but from them that have few ye shall give few:
           every one shall give of his cities unto the Levites according
           to his inheritance which he inheriteth.

04:035:009 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

04:035:010 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye
           be come over Jordan into the land of Canaan;

04:035:011 Then ye shall appoint you cities to be cities of refuge for
           you; that the slayer may flee thither, which killeth any
           person at unawares.

04:035:012 And they shall be unto you cities for refuge from the avenger;
           that the manslayer die not, until he stand before the
           congregation in judgment.

04:035:013 And of these cities which ye shall give six cities shall ye
           have for refuge.

04:035:014 Ye shall give three cities on this side Jordan, and three
           cities shall ye give in the land of Canaan, which shall be
           cities of refuge.

04:035:015 These six cities shall be a refuge, both for the children of
           Israel, and for the stranger, and for the sojourner among
           them: that every one that killeth any person unawares may flee
           thither.

04:035:016 And if he smite him with an instrument of iron, so that he
           die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to
           death.

04:035:017 And if he smite him with throwing a stone, wherewith he may
           die, and he die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely
           be put to death.

04:035:018 Or if he smite him with an hand weapon of wood, wherewith he
           may die, and he die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall
           surely be put to death.

04:035:019 The revenger of blood himself shall slay the murderer: when he
           meeteth him, he shall slay him.

04:035:020 But if he thrust him of hatred, or hurl at him by laying of
           wait, that he die;

04:035:021 Or in enmity smite him with his hand, that he die: he that
           smote him shall surely be put to death; for he is a murderer:
           the revenger of blood shall slay the murderer, when he meeteth
           him.

04:035:022 But if he thrust him suddenly without enmity, or have cast
           upon him any thing without laying of wait,

04:035:023 Or with any stone, wherewith a man may die, seeing him not,
           and cast it upon him, that he die, and was not his enemy,
           neither sought his harm:

04:035:024 Then the congregation shall judge between the slayer and the
           revenger of blood according to these judgments:

04:035:025 And the congregation shall deliver the slayer out of the hand
           of the revenger of blood, and the congregation shall restore
           him to the city of his refuge, whither he was fled: and he
           shall abide in it unto the death of the high priest, which was
           anointed with the holy oil.

04:035:026 But if the slayer shall at any time come without the border of
           the city of his refuge, whither he was fled;

04:035:027 And the revenger of blood find him without the borders of the
           city of his refuge, and the revenger of blood kill the slayer;
           he shall not be guilty of blood:

04:035:028 Because he should have remained in the city of his refuge
           until the death of the high priest: but after the death of the
           high priest the slayer shall return into the land of his
           possession.

04:035:029 So these things shall be for a statute of judgment unto you
           throughout your generations in all your dwellings.

04:035:030 Whoso killeth any person, the murderer shall be put to death
           by the mouth of witnesses: but one witness shall not testify
           against any person to cause him to die.

04:035:031 Moreover ye shall take no satisfaction for the life of a
           murderer, which is guilty of death: but he shall be surely put
           to death.

04:035:032 And ye shall take no satisfaction for him that is fled to the
           city of his refuge, that he should come again to dwell in the
           land, until the death of the priest.

04:035:033 So ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye are: for blood it
           defileth the land: and the land cannot be cleansed of the
           blood that is shed therein, but by the blood of him that shed
           it.

04:035:034 Defile not therefore the land which ye shall inhabit, wherein
           I dwell: for I the LORD dwell among the children of Israel.

04:036:001 And the chief fathers of the families of the children of
           Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the
           families of the sons of Joseph, came near, and spake before
           Moses, and before the princes, the chief fathers of the
           children of Israel:

04:036:002 And they said, The LORD commanded my lord to give the land for
           an inheritance by lot to the children of Israel: and my lord
           was commanded by the LORD to give the inheritance of
           Zelophehad our brother unto his daughters.

04:036:003 And if they be married to any of the sons of the other tribes
           of the children of Israel, then shall their inheritance be
           taken from the inheritance of our fathers, and shall be put to
           the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they are received: so
           shall it be taken from the lot of our inheritance.

04:036:004 And when the jubile of the children of Israel shall be, then
           shall their inheritance be put unto the inheritance of the
           tribe whereunto they are received: so shall their inheritance
           be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our
           fathers.

04:036:005 And Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the
           word of the LORD, saying, The tribe of the sons of Joseph hath
           said well.

04:036:006 This is the thing which the LORD doth command concerning the
           daughters of Zelophehad, saying, Let them marry to whom they
           think best; only to the family of the tribe of their father
           shall they marry.

04:036:007 So shall not the inheritance of the children of Israel remove
           from tribe to tribe: for every one of the children of Israel
           shall keep himself to the inheritance of the tribe of his
           fathers.

04:036:008 And every daughter, that possesseth an inheritance in any
           tribe of the children of Israel, shall be wife unto one of the
           family of the tribe of her father, that the children of Israel
           may enjoy every man the inheritance of his fathers.

04:036:009 Neither shall the inheritance remove from one tribe to another
           tribe; but every one of the tribes of the children of Israel
           shall keep himself to his own inheritance.

04:036:010 Even as the LORD commanded Moses, so did the daughters of
           Zelophehad:

04:036:011 For Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, the
           daughters of Zelophehad, were married unto their father's
           brothers' sons:

04:036:012 And they were married into the families of the sons of
           Manasseh the son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained in
           the tribe of the family of their father.

04:036:013 These are the commandments and the judgments, which the LORD
           commanded by the hand of Moses unto the children of Israel in
           the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho.

Book 05        Deuteronomy

05:001:001 These be the words which Moses spake unto all Israel on this
           side Jordan in the wilderness, in the plain over against the
           Red sea, between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth,
           and Dizahab.

05:001:002 (There are eleven days' journey from Horeb by the way of mount
           Seir unto Kadeshbarnea.)

05:001:003 And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh
           month, on the first day of the month, that Moses spake unto
           the children of Israel, according unto all that the LORD had
           given him in commandment unto them;

05:001:004 After he had slain Sihon the king of the Amorites, which dwelt
           in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, which dwelt at Astaroth
           in Edrei:

05:001:005 On this side Jordan, in the land of Moab, began Moses to
           declare this law, saying,

05:001:006 The LORD our God spake unto us in Horeb, saying, Ye have dwelt
           long enough in this mount:

05:001:007 Turn you, and take your journey, and go to the mount of the
           Amorites, and unto all the places nigh thereunto, in the
           plain, in the hills, and in the vale, and in the south, and by
           the sea side, to the land of the Canaanites, and unto Lebanon,
           unto the great river, the river Euphrates.

05:001:008 Behold, I have set the land before you: go in and possess the
           land which the LORD sware unto your fathers, Abraham, Isaac,
           and Jacob, to give unto them and to their seed after them.

05:001:009 And I spake unto you at that time, saying, I am not able to
           bear you myself alone:

05:001:010 The LORD your God hath multiplied you, and, behold, ye are
           this day as the stars of heaven for multitude.

05:001:011 (The LORD God of your fathers make you a thousand times so
           many more as ye are, and bless you, as he hath promised you!)

05:001:012 How can I myself alone bear your cumbrance, and your burden,
           and your strife?

05:001:013 Take you wise men, and understanding, and known among your
           tribes, and I will make them rulers over you.

05:001:014 And ye answered me, and said, The thing which thou hast spoken
           is good for us to do.

05:001:015 So I took the chief of your tribes, wise men, and known, and
           made them heads over you, captains over thousands, and
           captains over hundreds, and captains over fifties, and
           captains over tens, and officers among your tribes.

05:001:016 And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear the
           causes between your brethren, and judge righteously between
           every man and his brother, and the stranger that is with him.

05:001:017 Ye shall not respect persons in judgment; but ye shall hear
           the small as well as the great; ye shall not be afraid of the
           face of man; for the judgment is God's: and the cause that is
           too hard for you, bring it unto me, and I will hear it.

05:001:018 And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye
           should do.

05:001:019 And when we departed from Horeb, we went through all that
           great and terrible wilderness, which ye saw by the way of the
           mountain of the Amorites, as the LORD our God commanded us;
           and we came to Kadeshbarnea.

05:001:020 And I said unto you, Ye are come unto the mountain of the
           Amorites, which the LORD our God doth give unto us.

05:001:021 Behold, the LORD thy God hath set the land before thee: go up
           and possess it, as the LORD God of thy fathers hath said unto
           thee; fear not, neither be discouraged.

05:001:022 And ye came near unto me every one of you, and said, We will
           send men before us, and they shall search us out the land, and
           bring us word again by what way we must go up, and into what
           cities we shall come.

05:001:023 And the saying pleased me well: and I took twelve men of you,
           one of a tribe:

05:001:024 And they turned and went up into the mountain, and came unto
           the valley of Eshcol, and searched it out.

05:001:025 And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and
           brought it down unto us, and brought us word again, and said,
           It is a good land which the LORD our God doth give us.

05:001:026 Notwithstanding ye would not go up, but rebelled against the
           commandment of the LORD your God:

05:001:027 And ye murmured in your tents, and said, Because the LORD
           hated us, he hath brought us forth out of the land of Egypt,
           to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.

05:001:028 Whither shall we go up? our brethren have discouraged our
           heart, saying, The people is greater and taller than we; the
           cities are great and walled up to heaven; and moreover we have
           seen the sons of the Anakims there.

05:001:029 Then I said unto you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them.

05:001:030 The LORD your God which goeth before you, he shall fight for
           you, according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your
           eyes;

05:001:031 And in the wilderness, where thou hast seen how that the LORD
           thy God bare thee, as a man doth bear his son, in all the way
           that ye went, until ye came into this place.

05:001:032 Yet in this thing ye did not believe the LORD your God,

05:001:033 Who went in the way before you, to search you out a place to
           pitch your tents in, in fire by night, to shew you by what way
           ye should go, and in a cloud by day.

05:001:034 And the LORD heard the voice of your words, and was wroth, and
           sware, saying,

05:001:035 Surely there shall not one of these men of this evil
           generation see that good land, which I sware to give unto your
           fathers.

05:001:036 Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him
           will I give the land that he hath trodden upon, and to his
           children, because he hath wholly followed the LORD.

05:001:037 Also the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, saying, Thou
           also shalt not go in thither.

05:001:038 But Joshua the son of Nun, which standeth before thee, he
           shall go in thither: encourage him: for he shall cause Israel
           to inherit it.

05:001:039 Moreover your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, and
           your children, which in that day had no knowledge between good
           and evil, they shall go in thither, and unto them will I give
           it, and they shall possess it.

05:001:040 But as for you, turn you, and take your journey into the
           wilderness by the way of the Red sea.

05:001:041 Then ye answered and said unto me, We have sinned against the
           LORD, we will go up and fight, according to all that the LORD
           our God commanded us. And when ye had girded on every man his
           weapons of war, ye were ready to go up into the hill.

05:001:042 And the LORD said unto me, Say unto them. Go not up, neither
           fight; for I am not among you; lest ye be smitten before your
           enemies.

05:001:043 So I spake unto you; and ye would not hear, but rebelled
           against the commandment of the LORD, and went presumptuously
           up into the hill.

05:001:044 And the Amorites, which dwelt in that mountain, came out
           against you, and chased you, as bees do, and destroyed you in
           Seir, even unto Hormah.

05:001:045 And ye returned and wept before the LORD; but the LORD would
           not hearken to your voice, nor give ear unto you.

05:001:046 So ye abode in Kadesh many days, according unto the days that
           ye abode there.

05:002:001 Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by
           the way of the Red sea, as the LORD spake unto me: and we
           compassed mount Seir many days.

05:002:002 And the LORD spake unto me, saying,

05:002:003 Ye have compassed this mountain long enough: turn you
           northward.

05:002:004 And command thou the people, saying, Ye are to pass through
           the coast of your brethren the children of Esau, which dwell
           in Seir; and they shall be afraid of you: take ye good heed
           unto yourselves therefore:

05:002:005 Meddle not with them; for I will not give you of their land,
           no, not so much as a foot breadth; because I have given mount
           Seir unto Esau for a possession.

05:002:006 Ye shall buy meat of them for money, that ye may eat; and ye
           shall also buy water of them for money, that ye may drink.

05:002:007 For the LORD thy God hath blessed thee in all the works of thy
           hand: he knoweth thy walking through this great wilderness:
           these forty years the LORD thy God hath been with thee; thou
           hast lacked nothing.

05:002:008 And when we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau,
           which dwelt in Seir, through the way of the plain from Elath,
           and from Eziongaber, we turned and passed by the way of the
           wilderness of Moab.

05:002:009 And the LORD said unto me, Distress not the Moabites, neither
           contend with them in battle: for I will not give thee of their
           land for a possession; because I have given Ar unto the
           children of Lot for a possession.

05:002:010 The Emims dwelt therein in times past, a people great, and
           many, and tall, as the Anakims;

05:002:011 Which also were accounted giants, as the Anakims; but the
           Moabites called them Emims.

05:002:012 The Horims also dwelt in Seir beforetime; but the children of
           Esau succeeded them, when they had destroyed them from before
           them, and dwelt in their stead; as Israel did unto the land of
           his possession, which the LORD gave unto them.

05:002:013 Now rise up, said I, and get you over the brook Zered. And we
           went over the brook Zered.

05:002:014 And the space in which we came from Kadeshbarnea, until we
           were come over the brook Zered, was thirty and eight years;
           until all the generation of the men of war were wasted out
           from among the host, as the LORD sware unto them.

05:002:015 For indeed the hand of the LORD was against them, to destroy
           them from among the host, until they were consumed.

05:002:016 So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and
           dead from among the people,

05:002:017 That the LORD spake unto me, saying,

05:002:018 Thou art to pass over through Ar, the coast of Moab, this day:

05:002:019 And when thou comest nigh over against the children of Ammon,
           distress them not, nor meddle with them: for I will not give
           thee of the land of the children of Ammon any possession;
           because I have given it unto the children of Lot for a
           possession.

05:002:020 (That also was accounted a land of giants: giants dwelt
           therein in old time; and the Ammonites call them Zamzummims;

05:002:021 A people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims; but the
           LORD destroyed them before them; and they succeeded them, and
           dwelt in their stead:

05:002:022 As he did to the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, when
           he destroyed the Horims from before them; and they succeeded
           them, and dwelt in their stead even unto this day:

05:002:023 And the Avims which dwelt in Hazerim, even unto Azzah, the
           Caphtorims, which came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them,
           and dwelt in their stead.)

05:002:024 Rise ye up, take your journey, and pass over the river Arnon:
           behold, I have given into thine hand Sihon the Amorite, king
           of Heshbon, and his land: begin to possess it, and contend
           with him in battle.

05:002:025 This day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of
           thee upon the nations that are under the whole heaven, who
           shall hear report of thee, and shall tremble, and be in
           anguish because of thee.

05:002:026 And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth unto
           Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying,

05:002:027 Let me pass through thy land: I will go along by the high way,
           I will neither turn unto the right hand nor to the left.

05:002:028 Thou shalt sell me meat for money, that I may eat; and give me
           water for money, that I may drink: only I will pass through on
           my feet;

05:002:029 (As the children of Esau which dwell in Seir, and the Moabites
           which dwell in Ar, did unto me;) until I shall pass over
           Jordan into the land which the LORD our God giveth us.

05:002:030 But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him: for
           the LORD thy God hardened his spirit, and made his heart
           obstinate, that he might deliver him into thy hand, as
           appeareth this day.

05:002:031 And the LORD said unto me, Behold, I have begun to give Sihon
           and his land before thee: begin to possess, that thou mayest
           inherit his land.

05:002:032 Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to
           fight at Jahaz.

05:002:033 And the LORD our God delivered him before us; and we smote
           him, and his sons, and all his people.

05:002:034 And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed
           the men, and the women, and the little ones, of every city, we
           left none to remain:

05:002:035 Only the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves, and the
           spoil of the cities which we took.

05:002:036 From Aroer, which is by the brink of the river of Arnon, and
           from the city that is by the river, even unto Gilead, there
           was not one city too strong for us: the LORD our God delivered
           all unto us:

05:002:037 Only unto the land of the children of Ammon thou camest not,
           nor unto any place of the river Jabbok, nor unto the cities in
           the mountains, nor unto whatsoever the LORD our God forbad us.

05:003:001 Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king
           of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to
           battle at Edrei.

05:003:002 And the LORD said unto me, Fear him not: for I will deliver
           him, and all his people, and his land, into thy hand; and thou
           shalt do unto him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the
           Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon.

05:003:003 So the LORD our God delivered into our hands Og also, the king
           of Bashan, and all his people: and we smote him until none was
           left to him remaining.

05:003:004 And we took all his cities at that time, there was not a city
           which we took not from them, threescore cities, all the region
           of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.

05:003:005 All these cities were fenced with high walls, gates, and bars;
           beside unwalled towns a great many.

05:003:006 And we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sihon king of
           Heshbon, utterly destroying the men, women, and children, of
           every city.

05:003:007 But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a
           prey to ourselves.

05:003:008 And we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of
           the Amorites the land that was on this side Jordan, from the
           river of Arnon unto mount Hermon;

05:003:009 (Which Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion; and the Amorites call
           it Shenir;)

05:003:010 All the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan,
           unto Salchah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.

05:003:011 For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants;
           behold his bedstead was a bedstead of iron; is it not in
           Rabbath of the children of Ammon? nine cubits was the length
           thereof, and four cubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of
           a man.

05:003:012 And this land, which we possessed at that time, from Aroer,
           which is by the river Arnon, and half mount Gilead, and the
           cities thereof, gave I unto the Reubenites and to the Gadites.

05:003:013 And the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, being the kingdom of
           Og, gave I unto the half tribe of Manasseh; all the region of
           Argob, with all Bashan, which was called the land of giants.

05:003:014 Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob unto
           the coasts of Geshuri and Maachathi; and called them after his
           own name, Bashanhavothjair, unto this day.

05:003:015 And I gave Gilead unto Machir.

05:003:016 And unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from
           Gilead even unto the river Arnon half the valley, and the
           border even unto the river Jabbok, which is the border of the
           children of Ammon;

05:003:017 The plain also, and Jordan, and the coast thereof, from
           Chinnereth even unto the sea of the plain, even the salt sea,
           under Ashdothpisgah eastward.

05:003:018 And I commanded you at that time, saying, The LORD your God
           hath given you this land to possess it: ye shall pass over
           armed before your brethren the children of Israel, all that
           are meet for the war.

05:003:019 But your wives, and your little ones, and your cattle, (for I
           know that ye have much cattle,) shall abide in your cities
           which I have given you;

05:003:020 Until the LORD have given rest unto your brethren, as well as
           unto you, and until they also possess the land which the LORD
           your God hath given them beyond Jordan: and then shall ye
           return every man unto his possession, which I have given you.

05:003:021 And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Thine eyes have
           seen all that the LORD your God hath done unto these two
           kings: so shall the LORD do unto all the kingdoms whither thou
           passest.

05:003:022 Ye shall not fear them: for the LORD your God he shall fight
           for you.

05:003:023 And I besought the LORD at that time, saying,

05:003:024 O Lord GOD, thou hast begun to shew thy servant thy greatness,
           and thy mighty hand: for what God is there in heaven or in
           earth, that can do according to thy works, and according to
           thy might?

05:003:025 I pray thee, let me go over, and see the good land that is
           beyond Jordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon.

05:003:026 But the LORD was wroth with me for your sakes, and would not
           hear me: and the LORD said unto me, Let it suffice thee; speak
           no more unto me of this matter.

05:003:027 Get thee up into the top of Pisgah, and lift up thine eyes
           westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and
           behold it with thine eyes: for thou shalt not go over this
           Jordan.

05:003:028 But charge Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him: for
           he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them
           to inherit the land which thou shalt see.

05:003:029 So we abode in the valley over against Bethpeor.

05:004:001 Now therefore hearken, O Israel, unto the statutes and unto
           the judgments, which I teach you, for to do them, that ye may
           live, and go in and possess the land which the LORD God of
           your fathers giveth you.

05:004:002 Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither
           shall ye diminish ought from it, that ye may keep the
           commandments of the LORD your God which I command you.

05:004:003 Your eyes have seen what the LORD did because of Baalpeor: for
           all the men that followed Baalpeor, the LORD thy God hath
           destroyed them from among you.

05:004:004 But ye that did cleave unto the LORD your God are alive every
           one of you this day.

05:004:005 Behold, I have taught you statutes and judgments, even as the
           LORD my God commanded me, that ye should do so in the land
           whither ye go to possess it.

05:004:006 Keep therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom and your
           understanding in the sight of the nations, which shall hear
           all these statutes, and say, Surely this great nation is a
           wise and understanding people.

05:004:007 For what nation is there so great, who hath God so nigh unto
           them, as the LORD our God is in all things that we call upon
           him for?

05:004:008 And what nation is there so great, that hath statutes and
           judgments so righteous as all this law, which I set before you
           this day?

05:004:009 Only take heed to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently, lest
           thou forget the things which thine eyes have seen, and lest
           they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life: but teach
           them thy sons, and thy sons' sons;

05:004:010 Specially the day that thou stoodest before the LORD thy God
           in Horeb, when the LORD said unto me, Gather me the people
           together, and I will make them hear my words, that they may
           learn to fear me all the days that they shall live upon the
           earth, and that they may teach their children.

05:004:011 And ye came near and stood under the mountain; and the
           mountain burned with fire unto the midst of heaven, with
           darkness, clouds, and thick darkness.

05:004:012 And the LORD spake unto you out of the midst of the fire: ye
           heard the voice of the words, but saw no similitude; only ye
           heard a voice.

05:004:013 And he declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you
           to perform, even ten commandments; and he wrote them upon two
           tables of stone.

05:004:014 And the LORD commanded me at that time to teach you statutes
           and judgments, that ye might do them in the land whither ye go
           over to possess it.

05:004:015 Take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves; for ye saw no
           manner of similitude on the day that the LORD spake unto you
           in Horeb out of the midst of the fire:

05:004:016 Lest ye corrupt yourselves, and make you a graven image, the
           similitude of any figure, the likeness of male or female,

05:004:017 The likeness of any beast that is on the earth, the likeness
           of any winged fowl that flieth in the air,

05:004:018 The likeness of any thing that creepeth on the ground, the
           likeness of any fish that is in the waters beneath the earth:

05:004:019 And lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven, and when thou
           seest the sun, and the moon, and the stars, even all the host
           of heaven, shouldest be driven to worship them, and serve
           them, which the LORD thy God hath divided unto all nations
           under the whole heaven.

05:004:020 But the LORD hath taken you, and brought you forth out of the
           iron furnace, even out of Egypt, to be unto him a people of
           inheritance, as ye are this day.

05:004:021 Furthermore the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, and
           sware that I should not go over Jordan, and that I should not
           go in unto that good land, which the LORD thy God giveth thee
           for an inheritance:

05:004:022 But I must die in this land, I must not go over Jordan: but ye
           shall go over, and possess that good land.

05:004:023 Take heed unto yourselves, lest ye forget the covenant of the
           LORD your God, which he made with you, and make you a graven
           image, or the likeness of any thing, which the LORD thy God
           hath forbidden thee.

05:004:024 For the LORD thy God is a consuming fire, even a jealous God.

05:004:025 When thou shalt beget children, and children's children, and
           ye shall have remained long in the land, and shall corrupt
           yourselves, and make a graven image, or the likeness of any
           thing, and shall do evil in the sight of the LORD thy God, to
           provoke him to anger:

05:004:026 I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that
           ye shall soon utterly perish from off the land whereunto ye go
           over Jordan to possess it; ye shall not prolong your days upon
           it, but shall utterly be destroyed.

05:004:027 And the LORD shall scatter you among the nations, and ye shall
           be left few in number among the heathen, whither the LORD
           shall lead you.

05:004:028 And there ye shall serve gods, the work of men's hands, wood
           and stone, which neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell.

05:004:029 But if from thence thou shalt seek the LORD thy God, thou
           shalt find him, if thou seek him with all thy heart and with
           all thy soul.

05:004:030 When thou art in tribulation, and all these things are come
           upon thee, even in the latter days, if thou turn to the LORD
           thy God, and shalt be obedient unto his voice;

05:004:031 (For the LORD thy God is a merciful God;) he will not forsake
           thee, neither destroy thee, nor forget the covenant of thy
           fathers which he sware unto them.

05:004:032 For ask now of the days that are past, which were before thee,
           since the day that God created man upon the earth, and ask
           from the one side of heaven unto the other, whether there hath
           been any such thing as this great thing is, or hath been heard
           like it?

05:004:033 Did ever people hear the voice of God speaking out of the
           midst of the fire, as thou hast heard, and live?

05:004:034 Or hath God assayed to go and take him a nation from the midst
           of another nation, by temptations, by signs, and by wonders,
           and by war, and by a mighty hand, and by a stretched out arm,
           and by great terrors, according to all that the LORD your God
           did for you in Egypt before your eyes?

05:004:035 Unto thee it was shewed, that thou mightest know that the LORD
           he is God; there is none else beside him.

05:004:036 Out of heaven he made thee to hear his voice, that he might
           instruct thee: and upon earth he shewed thee his great fire;
           and thou heardest his words out of the midst of the fire.

05:004:037 And because he loved thy fathers, therefore he chose their
           seed after them, and brought thee out in his sight with his
           mighty power out of Egypt;

05:004:038 To drive out nations from before thee greater and mightier
           than thou art, to bring thee in, to give thee their land for
           an inheritance, as it is this day.

05:004:039 Know therefore this day, and consider it in thine heart, that
           the LORD he is God in heaven above, and upon the earth
           beneath: there is none else.

05:004:040 Thou shalt keep therefore his statutes, and his commandments,
           which I command thee this day, that it may go well with thee,
           and with thy children after thee, and that thou mayest prolong
           thy days upon the earth, which the LORD thy God giveth thee,
           for ever.

05:004:041 Then Moses severed three cities on this side Jordan toward the
           sunrising;

05:004:042 That the slayer might flee thither, which should kill his
           neighbour unawares, and hated him not in times past; and that
           fleeing unto one of these cities he might live:

05:004:043 Namely, Bezer in the wilderness, in the plain country, of the
           Reubenites; and Ramoth in Gilead, of the Gadites; and Golan in
           Bashan, of the Manassites.

05:004:044 And this is the law which Moses set before the children of
           Israel:

05:004:045 These are the testimonies, and the statutes, and the
           judgments, which Moses spake unto the children of Israel,
           after they came forth out of Egypt.

05:004:046 On this side Jordan, in the valley over against Bethpeor, in
           the land of Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon,
           whom Moses and the children of Israel smote, after they were
           come forth out of Egypt:

05:004:047 And they possessed his land, and the land of Og king of
           Bashan, two kings of the Amorites, which were on this side
           Jordan toward the sunrising;

05:004:048 From Aroer, which is by the bank of the river Arnon, even unto
           mount Sion, which is Hermon,

05:004:049 And all the plain on this side Jordan eastward, even unto the
           sea of the plain, under the springs of Pisgah.

05:005:001 And Moses called all Israel, and said unto them, Hear, O
           Israel, the statutes and judgments which I speak in your ears
           this day, that ye may learn them, and keep, and do them.

05:005:002 The LORD our God made a covenant with us in Horeb.

05:005:003 The LORD made not this covenant with our fathers, but with us,
           even us, who are all of us here alive this day.

05:005:004 The LORD talked with you face to face in the mount out of the
           midst of the fire,

05:005:005 (I stood between the LORD and you at that time, to shew you
           the word of the LORD: for ye were afraid by reason of the
           fire, and went not up into the mount;) saying,

05:005:006 I am the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of
           Egypt, from the house of bondage.

05:005:007 Thou shalt have none other gods before me.

05:005:008 Thou shalt not make thee any graven image, or any likeness of
           any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth
           beneath, or that is in the waters beneath the earth:

05:005:009 Thou shalt not bow down thyself unto them, nor serve them: for
           I the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of
           the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth
           generation of them that hate me,

05:005:010 And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep
           my commandments.

05:005:011 Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain: for
           the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in
           vain.

05:005:012 Keep the sabbath day to sanctify it, as the LORD thy God hath
           commanded thee.

05:005:013 Six days thou shalt labour, and do all thy work:

05:005:014 But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it
           thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy
           daughter, nor thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thine
           ox, nor thine ass, nor any of thy cattle, nor thy stranger
           that is within thy gates; that thy manservant and thy
           maidservant may rest as well as thou.

05:005:015 And remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt,
           and that the LORD thy God brought thee out thence through a
           mighty hand and by a stretched out arm: therefore the LORD thy
           God commanded thee to keep the sabbath day.

05:005:016 Honour thy father and thy mother, as the LORD thy God hath
           commanded thee; that thy days may be prolonged, and that it
           may go well with thee, in the land which the LORD thy God
           giveth thee.

05:005:017 Thou shalt not kill.

05:005:018 Neither shalt thou commit adultery.

05:005:019 Neither shalt thou steal.

05:005:020 Neither shalt thou bear false witness against thy neighbour.

05:005:021 Neither shalt thou desire thy neighbour's wife, neither shalt
           thou covet thy neighbour's house, his field, or his
           manservant, or his maidservant, his ox, or his ass, or any
           thing that is thy neighbour's.

05:005:022 These words the LORD spake unto all your assembly in the mount
           out of the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick
           darkness, with a great voice: and he added no more. And he
           wrote them in two tables of stone, and delivered them unto me.

05:005:023 And it came to pass, when ye heard the voice out of the midst
           of the darkness, (for the mountain did burn with fire,) that
           ye came near unto me, even all the heads of your tribes, and
           your elders;

05:005:024 And ye said, Behold, the LORD our God hath shewed us his glory
           and his greatness, and we have heard his voice out of the
           midst of the fire: we have seen this day that God doth talk
           with man, and he liveth.

05:005:025 Now therefore why should we die? for this great fire will
           consume us: if we hear the voice of the LORD our God any more,
           then we shall die.

05:005:026 For who is there of all flesh, that hath heard the voice of
           the living God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as we
           have, and lived?

05:005:027 Go thou near, and hear all that the LORD our God shall say:
           and speak thou unto us all that the LORD our God shall speak
           unto thee; and we will hear it, and do it.

05:005:028 And the LORD heard the voice of your words, when ye spake unto
           me; and the LORD said unto me, I have heard the voice of the
           words of this people, which they have spoken unto thee: they
           have well said all that they have spoken.

05:005:029 O that there were such an heart in them, that they would fear
           me, and keep all my commandments always, that it might be well
           with them, and with their children for ever!

05:005:030 Go say to them, Get you into your tents again.

05:005:031 But as for thee, stand thou here by me, and I will speak unto
           thee all the commandments, and the statutes, and the
           judgments, which thou shalt teach them, that they may do them
           in the land which I give them to possess it.

05:005:032 Ye shall observe to do therefore as the LORD your God hath
           commanded you: ye shall not turn aside to the right hand or to
           the left.

05:005:033 Ye shall walk in all the ways which the LORD your God hath
           commanded you, that ye may live, and that it may be well with
           you, and that ye may prolong your days in the land which ye
           shall possess.

05:006:001 Now these are the commandments, the statutes, and the
           judgments, which the LORD your God commanded to teach you,
           that ye might do them in the land whither ye go to possess it:

05:006:002 That thou mightest fear the LORD thy God, to keep all his
           statutes and his commandments, which I command thee, thou, and
           thy son, and thy son's son, all the days of thy life; and that
           thy days may be prolonged.

05:006:003 Hear therefore, O Israel, and observe to do it; that it may be
           well with thee, and that ye may increase mightily, as the LORD
           God of thy fathers hath promised thee, in the land that
           floweth with milk and honey.

05:006:004 Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God is one LORD:

05:006:005 And thou shalt love the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and
           with all thy soul, and with all thy might.

05:006:006 And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be in
           thine heart:

05:006:007 And thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and
           shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when
           thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when
           thou risest up.

05:006:008 And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they
           shall be as frontlets between thine eyes.

05:006:009 And thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house, and on
           thy gates.

05:006:010 And it shall be, when the LORD thy God shall have brought thee
           into the land which he sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to
           Isaac, and to Jacob, to give thee great and goodly cities,
           which thou buildedst not,

05:006:011 And houses full of all good things, which thou filledst not,
           and wells digged, which thou diggedst not, vineyards and olive
           trees, which thou plantedst not; when thou shalt have eaten
           and be full;

05:006:012 Then beware lest thou forget the LORD, which brought thee
           forth out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.

05:006:013 Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God, and serve him, and shalt
           swear by his name.

05:006:014 Ye shall not go after other gods, of the gods of the people
           which are round about you;

05:006:015 (For the LORD thy God is a jealous God among you) lest the
           anger of the LORD thy God be kindled against thee, and destroy
           thee from off the face of the earth.

05:006:016 Ye shall not tempt the LORD your God, as ye tempted him in
           Massah.

05:006:017 Ye shall diligently keep the commandments of the LORD your
           God, and his testimonies, and his statutes, which he hath
           commanded thee.

05:006:018 And thou shalt do that which is right and good in the sight of
           the LORD: that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest
           go in and possess the good land which the LORD sware unto thy
           fathers.

05:006:019 To cast out all thine enemies from before thee, as the LORD
           hath spoken.

05:006:020 And when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, What
           mean the testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgments,
           which the LORD our God hath commanded you?

05:006:021 Then thou shalt say unto thy son, We were Pharaoh's bondmen in
           Egypt; and the LORD brought us out of Egypt with a mighty
           hand:

05:006:022 And the LORD shewed signs and wonders, great and sore, upon
           Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his household, before our
           eyes:

05:006:023 And he brought us out from thence, that he might bring us in,
           to give us the land which he sware unto our fathers.

05:006:024 And the LORD commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear
           the LORD our God, for our good always, that he might preserve
           us alive, as it is at this day.

05:006:025 And it shall be our righteousness, if we observe to do all
           these commandments before the LORD our God, as he hath
           commanded us.

05:007:001 When the LORD thy God shall bring thee into the land whither
           thou goest to possess it, and hath cast out many nations
           before thee, the Hittites, and the Girgashites, and the
           Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, and the
           Hivites, and the Jebusites, seven nations greater and mightier
           than thou;

05:007:002 And when the LORD thy God shall deliver them before thee; thou
           shalt smite them, and utterly destroy them; thou shalt make no
           covenant with them, nor shew mercy unto them:

05:007:003 Neither shalt thou make marriages with them; thy daughter thou
           shalt not give unto his son, nor his daughter shalt thou take
           unto thy son.

05:007:004 For they will turn away thy son from following me, that they
           may serve other gods: so will the anger of the LORD be kindled
           against you, and destroy thee suddenly.

05:007:005 But thus shall ye deal with them; ye shall destroy their
           altars, and break down their images, and cut down their
           groves, and burn their graven images with fire.

05:007:006 For thou art an holy people unto the LORD thy God: the LORD
           thy God hath chosen thee to be a special people unto himself,
           above all people that are upon the face of the earth.

05:007:007 The LORD did not set his love upon you, nor choose you,
           because ye were more in number than any people; for ye were
           the fewest of all people:

05:007:008 But because the LORD loved you, and because he would keep the
           oath which he had sworn unto your fathers, hath the LORD
           brought you out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you out of
           the house of bondmen, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.

05:007:009 Know therefore that the LORD thy God, he is God, the faithful
           God, which keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him
           and keep his commandments to a thousand generations;

05:007:010 And repayeth them that hate him to their face, to destroy
           them: he will not be slack to him that hateth him, he will
           repay him to his face.

05:007:011 Thou shalt therefore keep the commandments, and the statutes,
           and the judgments, which I command thee this day, to do them.

05:007:012 Wherefore it shall come to pass, if ye hearken to these
           judgments, and keep, and do them, that the LORD thy God shall
           keep unto thee the covenant and the mercy which he sware unto
           thy fathers:

05:007:013 And he will love thee, and bless thee, and multiply thee: he
           will also bless the fruit of thy womb, and the fruit of thy
           land, thy corn, and thy wine, and thine oil, the increase of
           thy kine, and the flocks of thy sheep, in the land which he
           sware unto thy fathers to give thee.

05:007:014 Thou shalt be blessed above all people: there shall not be
           male or female barren among you, or among your cattle.

05:007:015 And the LORD will take away from thee all sickness, and will
           put none of the evil diseases of Egypt, which thou knowest,
           upon thee; but will lay them upon all them that hate thee.

05:007:016 And thou shalt consume all the people which the LORD thy God
           shall deliver thee; thine eye shall have no pity upon them:
           neither shalt thou serve their gods; for that will be a snare
           unto thee.

05:007:017 If thou shalt say in thine heart, These nations are more than
           I; how can I dispossess them?

05:007:018 Thou shalt not be afraid of them: but shalt well remember what
           the LORD thy God did unto Pharaoh, and unto all Egypt;

05:007:019 The great temptations which thine eyes saw, and the signs, and
           the wonders, and the mighty hand, and the stretched out arm,
           whereby the LORD thy God brought thee out: so shall the LORD
           thy God do unto all the people of whom thou art afraid.

05:007:020 Moreover the LORD thy God will send the hornet among them,
           until they that are left, and hide themselves from thee, be
           destroyed.

05:007:021 Thou shalt not be affrighted at them: for the LORD thy God is
           among you, a mighty God and terrible.

05:007:022 And the LORD thy God will put out those nations before thee by
           little and little: thou mayest not consume them at once, lest
           the beasts of the field increase upon thee.

05:007:023 But the LORD thy God shall deliver them unto thee, and shall
           destroy them with a mighty destruction, until they be
           destroyed.

05:007:024 And he shall deliver their kings into thine hand, and thou
           shalt destroy their name from under heaven: there shall no man
           be able to stand before thee, until thou have destroyed them.

05:007:025 The graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire: thou
           shalt not desire the silver or gold that is on them, nor take
           it unto thee, lest thou be snared therin: for it is an
           abomination to the LORD thy God.

05:007:026 Neither shalt thou bring an abomination into thine house, lest
           thou be a cursed thing like it: but thou shalt utterly detest
           it, and thou shalt utterly abhor it; for it is a cursed thing.

05:008:001 All the commandments which I command thee this day shall ye
           observe to do, that ye may live, and multiply, and go in and
           possess the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers.

05:008:002 And thou shalt remember all the way which the LORD thy God led
           thee these forty years in the wilderness, to humble thee, and
           to prove thee, to know what was in thine heart, whether thou
           wouldest keep his commandments, or no.

05:008:003 And he humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee
           with manna, which thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers
           know; that he might make thee know that man doth not live by
           bread only, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth
           of the LORD doth man live.

05:008:004 Thy raiment waxed not old upon thee, neither did thy foot
           swell, these forty years.

05:008:005 Thou shalt also consider in thine heart, that, as a man
           chasteneth his son, so the LORD thy God chasteneth thee.

05:008:006 Therefore thou shalt keep the commandments of the LORD thy
           God, to walk in his ways, and to fear him.

05:008:007 For the LORD thy God bringeth thee into a good land, a land of
           brooks of water, of fountains and depths that spring out of
           valleys and hills;

05:008:008 A land of wheat, and barley, and vines, and fig trees, and
           pomegranates; a land of oil olive, and honey;

05:008:009 A land wherein thou shalt eat bread without scarceness, thou
           shalt not lack any thing in it; a land whose stones are iron,
           and out of whose hills thou mayest dig brass.

05:008:010 When thou hast eaten and art full, then thou shalt bless the
           LORD thy God for the good land which he hath given thee.

05:008:011 Beware that thou forget not the LORD thy God, in not keeping
           his commandments, and his judgments, and his statutes, which I
           command thee this day:

05:008:012 Lest when thou hast eaten and art full, and hast built goodly
           houses, and dwelt therein;

05:008:013 And when thy herds and thy flocks multiply, and thy silver and
           thy gold is multiplied, and all that thou hast is multiplied;

05:008:014 Then thine heart be lifted up, and thou forget the LORD thy
           God, which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, from
           the house of bondage;

05:008:015 Who led thee through that great and terrible wilderness,
           wherein were fiery serpents, and scorpions, and drought, where
           there was no water; who brought thee forth water out of the
           rock of flint;

05:008:016 Who fed thee in the wilderness with manna, which thy fathers
           knew not, that he might humble thee, and that he might prove
           thee, to do thee good at thy latter end;

05:008:017 And thou say in thine heart, My power and the might of mine
           hand hath gotten me this wealth.

05:008:018 But thou shalt remember the LORD thy God: for it is he that
           giveth thee power to get wealth, that he may establish his
           covenant which he sware unto thy fathers, as it is this day.

05:008:019 And it shall be, if thou do at all forget the LORD thy God,
           and walk after other gods, and serve them, and worship them, I
           testify against you this day that ye shall surely perish.

05:008:020 As the nations which the LORD destroyeth before your face, so
           shall ye perish; because ye would not be obedient unto the
           voice of the LORD your God.

05:009:001 Hear, O Israel: Thou art to pass over Jordan this day, to go
           in to possess nations greater and mightier than thyself,
           cities great and fenced up to heaven,

05:009:002 A people great and tall, the children of the Anakims, whom
           thou knowest, and of whom thou hast heard say, Who can stand
           before the children of Anak!

05:009:003 Understand therefore this day, that the LORD thy God is he
           which goeth over before thee; as a consuming fire he shall
           destroy them, and he shall bring them down before thy face: so
           shalt thou drive them out, and destroy them quickly, as the
           LORD hath said unto thee.

05:009:004 Speak not thou in thine heart, after that the LORD thy God
           hath cast them out from before thee, saying, For my
           righteousness the LORD hath brought me in to possess this
           land: but for the wickedness of these nations the LORD doth
           drive them out from before thee.

05:009:005 Not for thy righteousness, or for the uprightness of thine
           heart, dost thou go to possess their land: but for the
           wickedness of these nations the LORD thy God doth drive them
           out from before thee, and that he may perform the word which
           the LORD sware unto thy fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

05:009:006 Understand therefore, that the LORD thy God giveth thee not
           this good land to possess it for thy righteousness; for thou
           art a stiffnecked people.

05:009:007 Remember, and forget not, how thou provokedst the LORD thy God
           to wrath in the wilderness: from the day that thou didst
           depart out of the land of Egypt, until ye came unto this
           place, ye have been rebellious against the LORD.

05:009:008 Also in Horeb ye provoked the LORD to wrath, so that the LORD
           was angry with you to have destroyed you.

05:009:009 When I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of
           stone, even the tables of the covenant which the LORD made
           with you, then I abode in the mount forty days and forty
           nights, I neither did eat bread nor drink water:

05:009:010 And the LORD delivered unto me two tables of stone written
           with the finger of God; and on them was written according to
           all the words, which the LORD spake with you in the mount out
           of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly.

05:009:011 And it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights,
           that the LORD gave me the two tables of stone, even the tables
           of the covenant.

05:009:012 And the LORD said unto me, Arise, get thee down quickly from
           hence; for thy people which thou hast brought forth out of
           Egypt have corrupted themselves; they are quickly turned aside
           out of the way which I commanded them; they have made them a
           molten image.

05:009:013 Furthermore the LORD spake unto me, saying, I have seen this
           people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people:

05:009:014 Let me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name
           from under heaven: and I will make of thee a nation mightier
           and greater than they.

05:009:015 So I turned and came down from the mount, and the mount burned
           with fire: and the two tables of the covenant were in my two
           hands.

05:009:016 And I looked, and, behold, ye had sinned against the LORD your
           God, and had made you a molten calf: ye had turned aside
           quickly out of the way which the LORD had commanded you.

05:009:017 And I took the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands,
           and brake them before your eyes.

05:009:018 And I fell down before the LORD, as at the first, forty days
           and forty nights: I did neither eat bread, nor drink water,
           because of all your sins which ye sinned, in doing wickedly in
           the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.

05:009:019 For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure, wherewith
           the LORD was wroth against you to destroy you. But the LORD
           hearkened unto me at that time also.

05:009:020 And the LORD was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed him:
           and I prayed for Aaron also the same time.

05:009:021 And I took your sin, the calf which ye had made, and burnt it
           with fire, and stamped it, and ground it very small, even
           until it was as small as dust: and I cast the dust thereof
           into the brook that descended out of the mount.

05:009:022 And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibrothhattaavah, ye
           provoked the LORD to wrath.

05:009:023 Likewise when the LORD sent you from Kadeshbarnea, saying, Go
           up and possess the land which I have given you; then ye
           rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God, and ye
           believed him not, nor hearkened to his voice.

05:009:024 Ye have been rebellious against the LORD from the day that I
           knew you.

05:009:025 Thus I fell down before the LORD forty days and forty nights,
           as I fell down at the first; because the LORD had said he
           would destroy you.

05:009:026 I prayed therefore unto the LORD, and said, O Lord GOD,
           destroy not thy people and thine inheritance, which thou hast
           redeemed through thy greatness, which thou hast brought forth
           out of Egypt with a mighty hand.

05:009:027 Remember thy servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not
           unto the stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness,
           nor to their sin:

05:009:028 Lest the land whence thou broughtest us out say, Because the
           LORD was not able to bring them into the land which he
           promised them, and because he hated them, he hath brought them
           out to slay them in the wilderness.

05:009:029 Yet they are thy people and thine inheritance, which thou
           broughtest out by thy mighty power and by thy stretched out
           arm.

05:010:001 At that time the LORD said unto me, Hew thee two tables of
           stone like unto the first, and come up unto me into the mount,
           and make thee an ark of wood.

05:010:002 And I will write on the tables the words that were in the
           first tables which thou brakest, and thou shalt put them in
           the ark.

05:010:003 And I made an ark of shittim wood, and hewed two tables of
           stone like unto the first, and went up into the mount, having
           the two tables in mine hand.

05:010:004 And he wrote on the tables, according to the first writing,
           the ten commandments, which the LORD spake unto you in the
           mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly:
           and the LORD gave them unto me.

05:010:005 And I turned myself and came down from the mount, and put the
           tables in the ark which I had made; and there they be, as the
           LORD commanded me.

05:010:006 And the children of Israel took their journey from Beeroth of
           the children of Jaakan to Mosera: there Aaron died, and there
           he was buried; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest's
           office in his stead.

05:010:007 From thence they journeyed unto Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah to
           Jotbath, a land of rivers of waters.

05:010:008 At that time the LORD separated the tribe of Levi, to bear the
           ark of the covenant of the LORD, to stand before the LORD to
           minister unto him, and to bless in his name, unto this day.

05:010:009 Wherefore Levi hath no part nor inheritance with his brethren;
           the LORD is his inheritance, according as the LORD thy God
           promised him.

05:010:010 And I stayed in the mount, according to the first time, forty
           days and forty nights; and the LORD hearkened unto me at that
           time also, and the LORD would not destroy thee.

05:010:011 And the LORD said unto me, Arise, take thy journey before the
           people, that they may go in and possess the land, which I
           sware unto their fathers to give unto them.

05:010:012 And now, Israel, what doth the LORD thy God require of thee,
           but to fear the LORD thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to
           love him, and to serve the LORD thy God with all thy heart and
           with all thy soul,

05:010:013 To keep the commandments of the LORD, and his statutes, which
           I command thee this day for thy good?

05:010:014 Behold, the heaven and the heaven of heavens is the LORD's thy
           God, the earth also, with all that therein is.

05:010:015 Only the LORD had a delight in thy fathers to love them, and
           he chose their seed after them, even you above all people, as
           it is this day.

05:010:016 Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no
           more stiffnecked.

05:010:017 For the LORD your God is God of gods, and Lord of lords, a
           great God, a mighty, and a terrible, which regardeth not
           persons, nor taketh reward:

05:010:018 He doth execute the judgment of the fatherless and widow, and
           loveth the stranger, in giving him food and raiment.

05:010:019 Love ye therefore the stranger: for ye were strangers in the
           land of Egypt.

05:010:020 Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God; him shalt thou serve, and to
           him shalt thou cleave, and swear by his name.

05:010:021 He is thy praise, and he is thy God, that hath done for thee
           these great and terrible things, which thine eyes have seen.

05:010:022 Thy fathers went down into Egypt with threescore and ten
           persons; and now the LORD thy God hath made thee as the stars
           of heaven for multitude.

05:011:001 Therefore thou shalt love the LORD thy God, and keep his
           charge, and his statutes, and his judgments, and his
           commandments, alway.

05:011:002 And know ye this day: for I speak not with your children which
           have not known, and which have not seen the chastisement of
           the LORD your God, his greatness, his mighty hand, and his
           stretched out arm,

05:011:003 And his miracles, and his acts, which he did in the midst of
           Egypt unto Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and unto all his land;

05:011:004 And what he did unto the army of Egypt, unto their horses, and
           to their chariots; how he made the water of the Red sea to
           overflow them as they pursued after you, and how the LORD hath
           destroyed them unto this day;

05:011:005 And what he did unto you in the wilderness, until ye came into
           this place;

05:011:006 And what he did unto Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the
           son of Reuben: how the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed
           them up, and their households, and their tents, and all the
           substance that was in their possession, in the midst of all
           Israel:

05:011:007 But your eyes have seen all the great acts of the LORD which
           he did.

05:011:008 Therefore shall ye keep all the commandments which I command
           you this day, that ye may be strong, and go in and possess the
           land, whither ye go to possess it;

05:011:009 And that ye may prolong your days in the land, which the LORD
           sware unto your fathers to give unto them and to their seed, a
           land that floweth with milk and honey.

05:011:010 For the land, whither thou goest in to possess it, is not as
           the land of Egypt, from whence ye came out, where thou sowedst
           thy seed, and wateredst it with thy foot, as a garden of
           herbs:

05:011:011 But the land, whither ye go to possess it, is a land of hills
           and valleys, and drinketh water of the rain of heaven:

05:011:012 A land which the LORD thy God careth for: the eyes of the LORD
           thy God are always upon it, from the beginning of the year
           even unto the end of the year.

05:011:013 And it shall come to pass, if ye shall hearken diligently unto
           my commandments which I command you this day, to love the LORD
           your God, and to serve him with all your heart and with all
           your soul,

05:011:014 That I will give you the rain of your land in his due season,
           the first rain and the latter rain, that thou mayest gather in
           thy corn, and thy wine, and thine oil.

05:011:015 And I will send grass in thy fields for thy cattle, that thou
           mayest eat and be full.

05:011:016 Take heed to yourselves, that your heart be not deceived, and
           ye turn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them;

05:011:017 And then the LORD's wrath be kindled against you, and he shut
           up the heaven, that there be no rain, and that the land yield
           not her fruit; and lest ye perish quickly from off the good
           land which the LORD giveth you.

05:011:018 Therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in
           your soul, and bind them for a sign upon your hand, that they
           may be as frontlets between your eyes.

05:011:019 And ye shall teach them your children, speaking of them when
           thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way,
           when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.

05:011:020 And thou shalt write them upon the door posts of thine house,
           and upon thy gates:

05:011:021 That your days may be multiplied, and the days of your
           children, in the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers
           to give them, as the days of heaven upon the earth.

05:011:022 For if ye shall diligently keep all these commandments which I
           command you, to do them, to love the LORD your God, to walk in
           all his ways, and to cleave unto him;

05:011:023 Then will the LORD drive out all these nations from before
           you, and ye shall possess greater nations and mightier than
           yourselves.

05:011:024 Every place whereon the soles of your feet shall tread shall
           be yours: from the wilderness and Lebanon, from the river, the
           river Euphrates, even unto the uttermost sea shall your coast
           be.

05:011:025 There shall no man be able to stand before you: for the LORD
           your God shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon
           all the land that ye shall tread upon, as he hath said unto
           you.

05:011:026 Behold, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse;

05:011:027 A blessing, if ye obey the commandments of the LORD your God,
           which I command you this day:

05:011:028 And a curse, if ye will not obey the commandments of the LORD
           your God, but turn aside out of the way which I command you
           this day, to go after other gods, which ye have not known.

05:011:029 And it shall come to pass, when the LORD thy God hath brought
           thee in unto the land whither thou goest to possess it, that
           thou shalt put the blessing upon mount Gerizim, and the curse
           upon mount Ebal.

05:011:030 Are they not on the other side Jordan, by the way where the
           sun goeth down, in the land of the Canaanites, which dwell in
           the champaign over against Gilgal, beside the plains of Moreh?

05:011:031 For ye shall pass over Jordan to go in to possess the land
           which the LORD your God giveth you, and ye shall possess it,
           and dwell therein.

05:011:032 And ye shall observe to do all the statutes and judgments
           which I set before you this day.

05:012:001 These are the statutes and judgments, which ye shall observe
           to do in the land, which the LORD God of thy fathers giveth
           thee to possess it, all the days that ye live upon the earth.

05:012:002 Ye shall utterly destroy all the places, wherein the nations
           which ye shall possess served their gods, upon the high
           mountains, and upon the hills, and under every green tree:

05:012:003 And ye shall overthrow their altars, and break their pillars,
           and burn their groves with fire; and ye shall hew down the
           graven images of their gods, and destroy the names of them out
           of that place.

05:012:004 Ye shall not do so unto the LORD your God.

05:012:005 But unto the place which the LORD your God shall choose out of
           all your tribes to put his name there, even unto his
           habitation shall ye seek, and thither thou shalt come:

05:012:006 And thither ye shall bring your burnt offerings, and your
           sacrifices, and your tithes, and heave offerings of your hand,
           and your vows, and your freewill offerings, and the firstlings
           of your herds and of your flocks:

05:012:007 And there ye shall eat before the LORD your God, and ye shall
           rejoice in all that ye put your hand unto, ye and your
           households, wherein the LORD thy God hath blessed thee.

05:012:008 Ye shall not do after all the things that we do here this day,
           every man whatsoever is right in his own eyes.

05:012:009 For ye are not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance,
           which the LORD your God giveth you.

05:012:010 But when ye go over Jordan, and dwell in the land which the
           LORD your God giveth you to inherit, and when he giveth you
           rest from all your enemies round about, so that ye dwell in
           safety;

05:012:011 Then there shall be a place which the LORD your God shall
           choose to cause his name to dwell there; thither shall ye
           bring all that I command you; your burnt offerings, and your
           sacrifices, your tithes, and the heave offering of your hand,
           and all your choice vows which ye vow unto the LORD:

05:012:012 And ye shall rejoice before the LORD your God, ye, and your
           sons, and your daughters, and your menservants, and your
           maidservants, and the Levite that is within your gates;
           forasmuch as he hath no part nor inheritance with you.

05:012:013 Take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy burnt offerings
           in every place that thou seest:

05:012:014 But in the place which the LORD shall choose in one of thy
           tribes, there thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings, and there
           thou shalt do all that I command thee.

05:012:015 Notwithstanding thou mayest kill and eat flesh in all thy
           gates, whatsoever thy soul lusteth after, according to the
           blessing of the LORD thy God which he hath given thee: the
           unclean and the clean may eat thereof, as of the roebuck, and
           as of the hart.

05:012:016 Only ye shall not eat the blood; ye shall pour it upon the
           earth as water.

05:012:017 Thou mayest not eat within thy gates the tithe of thy corn, or
           of thy wine, or of thy oil, or the firstlings of thy herds or
           of thy flock, nor any of thy vows which thou vowest, nor thy
           freewill offerings, or heave offering of thine hand:

05:012:018 But thou must eat them before the LORD thy God in the place
           which the LORD thy God shall choose, thou, and thy son, and
           thy daughter, and thy manservant, and thy maidservant, and the
           Levite that is within thy gates: and thou shalt rejoice before
           the LORD thy God in all that thou puttest thine hands unto.

05:012:019 Take heed to thyself that thou forsake not the Levite as long
           as thou livest upon the earth.

05:012:020 When the LORD thy God shall enlarge thy border, as he hath
           promised thee, and thou shalt say, I will eat flesh, because
           thy soul longeth to eat flesh; thou mayest eat flesh,
           whatsoever thy soul lusteth after.

05:012:021 If the place which the LORD thy God hath chosen to put his
           name there be too far from thee, then thou shalt kill of thy
           herd and of thy flock, which the LORD hath given thee, as I
           have commanded thee, and thou shalt eat in thy gates
           whatsoever thy soul lusteth after.

05:012:022 Even as the roebuck and the hart is eaten, so thou shalt eat
           them: the unclean and the clean shall eat of them alike.

05:012:023 Only be sure that thou eat not the blood: for the blood is the
           life; and thou mayest not eat the life with the flesh.

05:012:024 Thou shalt not eat it; thou shalt pour it upon the earth as
           water.

05:012:025 Thou shalt not eat it; that it may go well with thee, and with
           thy children after thee, when thou shalt do that which is
           right in the sight of the LORD.

05:012:026 Only thy holy things which thou hast, and thy vows, thou shalt
           take, and go unto the place which the LORD shall choose:

05:012:027 And thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings, the flesh and the
           blood, upon the altar of the LORD thy God: and the blood of
           thy sacrifices shall be poured out upon the altar of the LORD
           thy God, and thou shalt eat the flesh.

05:012:028 Observe and hear all these words which I command thee, that it
           may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee for
           ever, when thou doest that which is good and right in the
           sight of the LORD thy God.

05:012:029 When the LORD thy God shall cut off the nations from before
           thee, whither thou goest to possess them, and thou succeedest
           them, and dwellest in their land;

05:012:030 Take heed to thyself that thou be not snared by following
           them, after that they be destroyed from before thee; and that
           thou enquire not after their gods, saying, How did these
           nations serve their gods? even so will I do likewise.

05:012:031 Thou shalt not do so unto the LORD thy God: for every
           abomination to the LORD, which he hateth, have they done unto
           their gods; for even their sons and their daughters they have
           burnt in the fire to their gods.

05:012:032 What thing soever I command you, observe to do it: thou shalt
           not add thereto, nor diminish from it.

05:013:001 If there arise among you a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams,
           and giveth thee a sign or a wonder,

05:013:002 And the sign or the wonder come to pass, whereof he spake unto
           thee, saying, Let us go after other gods, which thou hast not
           known, and let us serve them;

05:013:003 Thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet, or that
           dreamer of dreams: for the LORD your God proveth you, to know
           whether ye love the LORD your God with all your heart and with
           all your soul.

05:013:004 Ye shall walk after the LORD your God, and fear him, and keep
           his commandments, and obey his voice, and ye shall serve him,
           and cleave unto him.

05:013:005 And that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams, shall be put to
           death; because he hath spoken to turn you away from the LORD
           your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt, and
           redeemed you out of the house of bondage, to thrust thee out
           of the way which the LORD thy God commanded thee to walk in.
           So shalt thou put the evil away from the midst of thee.

05:013:006 If thy brother, the son of thy mother, or thy son, or thy
           daughter, or the wife of thy bosom, or thy friend, which is as
           thine own soul, entice thee secretly, saying, Let us go and
           serve other gods, which thou hast not known, thou, nor thy
           fathers;

05:013:007 Namely, of the gods of the people which are round about you,
           nigh unto thee, or far off from thee, from the one end of the
           earth even unto the other end of the earth;

05:013:008 Thou shalt not consent unto him, nor hearken unto him; neither
           shall thine eye pity him, neither shalt thou spare, neither
           shalt thou conceal him:

05:013:009 But thou shalt surely kill him; thine hand shall be first upon
           him to put him to death, and afterwards the hand of all the
           people.

05:013:010 And thou shalt stone him with stones, that he die; because he
           hath sought to thrust thee away from the LORD thy God, which
           brought thee out of the land of Egypt, from the house of
           bondage.

05:013:011 And all Israel shall hear, and fear, and shall do no more any
           such wickedness as this is among you.

05:013:012 If thou shalt hear say in one of thy cities, which the LORD
           thy God hath given thee to dwell there, saying,

05:013:013 Certain men, the children of Belial, are gone out from among
           you, and have withdrawn the inhabitants of their city, saying,
           Let us go and serve other gods, which ye have not known;

05:013:014 Then shalt thou enquire, and make search, and ask diligently;
           and, behold, if it be truth, and the thing certain, that such
           abomination is wrought among you;

05:013:015 Thou shalt surely smite the inhabitants of that city with the
           edge of the sword, destroying it utterly, and all that is
           therein, and the cattle thereof, with the edge of the sword.

05:013:016 And thou shalt gather all the spoil of it into the midst of
           the street thereof, and shalt burn with fire the city, and all
           the spoil thereof every whit, for the LORD thy God: and it
           shall be an heap for ever; it shall not be built again.

05:013:017 And there shall cleave nought of the cursed thing to thine
           hand: that the LORD may turn from the fierceness of his anger,
           and shew thee mercy, and have compassion upon thee, and
           multiply thee, as he hath sworn unto thy fathers;

05:013:018 When thou shalt hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God, to
           keep all his commandments which I command thee this day, to do
           that which is right in the eyes of the LORD thy God.

05:014:001 Ye are the children of the LORD your God: ye shall not cut
           yourselves, nor make any baldness between your eyes for the
           dead.

05:014:002 For thou art an holy people unto the LORD thy God, and the
           LORD hath chosen thee to be a peculiar people unto himself,
           above all the nations that are upon the earth.

05:014:003 Thou shalt not eat any abominable thing.

05:014:004 These are the beasts which ye shall eat: the ox, the sheep,
           and the goat,

05:014:005 The hart, and the roebuck, and the fallow deer, and the wild
           goat, and the pygarg, and the wild ox, and the chamois.

05:014:006 And every beast that parteth the hoof, and cleaveth the cleft
           into two claws, and cheweth the cud among the beasts, that ye
           shall eat.

05:014:007 Nevertheless these ye shall not eat of them that chew the cud,
           or of them that divide the cloven hoof; as the camel, and the
           hare, and the coney: for they chew the cud, but divide not the
           hoof; therefore they are unclean unto you.

05:014:008 And the swine, because it divideth the hoof, yet cheweth not
           the cud, it is unclean unto you: ye shall not eat of their
           flesh, nor touch their dead carcase.

05:014:009 These ye shall eat of all that are in the waters: all that
           have fins and scales shall ye eat:

05:014:010 And whatsoever hath not fins and scales ye may not eat; it is
           unclean unto you.

05:014:011 Of all clean birds ye shall eat.

05:014:012 But these are they of which ye shall not eat: the eagle, and
           the ossifrage, and the ospray,

05:014:013 And the glede, and the kite, and the vulture after his kind,

05:014:014 And every raven after his kind,

05:014:015 And the owl, and the night hawk, and the cuckow, and the hawk
           after his kind,

05:014:016 The little owl, and the great owl, and the swan,

05:014:017 And the pelican, and the gier eagle, and the cormorant,

05:014:018 And the stork, and the heron after her kind, and the lapwing,
           and the bat.

05:014:019 And every creeping thing that flieth is unclean unto you: they
           shall not be eaten.

05:014:020 But of all clean fowls ye may eat.

05:014:021 Ye shall not eat of anything that dieth of itself: thou shalt
           give it unto the stranger that is in thy gates, that he may
           eat it; or thou mayest sell it unto an alien: for thou art an
           holy people unto the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid
           in his mother's milk.

05:014:022 Thou shalt truly tithe all the increase of thy seed, that the
           field bringeth forth year by year.

05:014:023 And thou shalt eat before the LORD thy God, in the place which
           he shall choose to place his name there, the tithe of thy
           corn, of thy wine, and of thine oil, and the firstlings of thy
           herds and of thy flocks; that thou mayest learn to fear the
           LORD thy God always.

05:014:024 And if the way be too long for thee, so that thou art not able
           to carry it; or if the place be too far from thee, which the
           LORD thy God shall choose to set his name there, when the LORD
           thy God hath blessed thee:

05:014:025 Then shalt thou turn it into money, and bind up the money in
           thine hand, and shalt go unto the place which the LORD thy God
           shall choose:

05:014:026 And thou shalt bestow that money for whatsoever thy soul
           lusteth after, for oxen, or for sheep, or for wine, or for
           strong drink, or for whatsoever thy soul desireth: and thou
           shalt eat there before the LORD thy God, and thou shalt
           rejoice, thou, and thine household,

05:014:027 And the Levite that is within thy gates; thou shalt not
           forsake him; for he hath no part nor inheritance with thee.

05:014:028 At the end of three years thou shalt bring forth all the tithe
           of thine increase the same year, and shalt lay it up within
           thy gates:

05:014:029 And the Levite, (because he hath no part nor inheritance with
           thee,) and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow,
           which are within thy gates, shall come, and shall eat and be
           satisfied; that the LORD thy God may bless thee in all the
           work of thine hand which thou doest.

05:015:001 At the end of every seven years thou shalt make a release.

05:015:002 And this is the manner of the release: Every creditor that
           lendeth ought unto his neighbour shall release it; he shall
           not exact it of his neighbour, or of his brother; because it
           is called the LORD's release.

05:015:003 Of a foreigner thou mayest exact it again: but that which is
           thine with thy brother thine hand shall release;

05:015:004 Save when there shall be no poor among you; for the LORD shall
           greatly bless thee in the land which the LORD thy God giveth
           thee for an inheritance to possess it:

05:015:005 Only if thou carefully hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy
           God, to observe to do all these commandments which I command
           thee this day.

05:015:006 For the LORD thy God blesseth thee, as he promised thee: and
           thou shalt lend unto many nations, but thou shalt not borrow;
           and thou shalt reign over many nations, but they shall not
           reign over thee.

05:015:007 If there be among you a poor man of one of thy brethren within
           any of thy gates in thy land which the LORD thy God giveth
           thee, thou shalt not harden thine heart, nor shut thine hand
           from thy poor brother:

05:015:008 But thou shalt open thine hand wide unto him, and shalt surely
           lend him sufficient for his need, in that which he wanteth.

05:015:009 Beware that there be not a thought in thy wicked heart,
           saying, The seventh year, the year of release, is at hand; and
           thine eye be evil against thy poor brother, and thou givest
           him nought; and he cry unto the LORD against thee, and it be
           sin unto thee.

05:015:010 Thou shalt surely give him, and thine heart shall not be
           grieved when thou givest unto him: because that for this thing
           the LORD thy God shall bless thee in all thy works, and in all
           that thou puttest thine hand unto.

05:015:011 For the poor shall never cease out of the land: therefore I
           command thee, saying, Thou shalt open thine hand wide unto thy
           brother, to thy poor, and to thy needy, in thy land.

05:015:012 And if thy brother, an Hebrew man, or an Hebrew woman, be sold
           unto thee, and serve thee six years; then in the seventh year
           thou shalt let him go free from thee.

05:015:013 And when thou sendest him out free from thee, thou shalt not
           let him go away empty:

05:015:014 Thou shalt furnish him liberally out of thy flock, and out of
           thy floor, and out of thy winepress: of that wherewith the
           LORD thy God hath blessed thee thou shalt give unto him.

05:015:015 And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land
           of Egypt, and the LORD thy God redeemed thee: therefore I
           command thee this thing to day.

05:015:016 And it shall be, if he say unto thee, I will not go away from
           thee; because he loveth thee and thine house, because he is
           well with thee;

05:015:017 Then thou shalt take an aul, and thrust it through his ear
           unto the door, and he shall be thy servant for ever. And also
           unto thy maidservant thou shalt do likewise.

05:015:018 It shall not seem hard unto thee, when thou sendest him away
           free from thee; for he hath been worth a double hired servant
           to thee, in serving thee six years: and the LORD thy God shall
           bless thee in all that thou doest.

05:015:019 All the firstling males that come of thy herd and of thy flock
           thou shalt sanctify unto the LORD thy God: thou shalt do no
           work with the firstling of thy bullock, nor shear the
           firstling of thy sheep.

05:015:020 Thou shalt eat it before the LORD thy God year by year in the
           place which the LORD shall choose, thou and thy household.

05:015:021 And if there be any blemish therein, as if it be lame, or
           blind, or have any ill blemish, thou shalt not sacrifice it
           unto the LORD thy God.

05:015:022 Thou shalt eat it within thy gates: the unclean and the clean
           person shall eat it alike, as the roebuck, and as the hart.

05:015:023 Only thou shalt not eat the blood thereof; thou shalt pour it
           upon the ground as water.

05:016:001 Observe the month of Abib, and keep the passover unto the LORD
           thy God: for in the month of Abib the LORD thy God brought
           thee forth out of Egypt by night.

05:016:002 Thou shalt therefore sacrifice the passover unto the LORD thy
           God, of the flock and the herd, in the place which the LORD
           shall choose to place his name there.

05:016:003 Thou shalt eat no leavened bread with it; seven days shalt
           thou eat unleavened bread therewith, even the bread of
           affliction; for thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt in
           haste: that thou mayest remember the day when thou camest
           forth out of the land of Egypt all the days of thy life.

05:016:004 And there shall be no leavened bread seen with thee in all thy
           coast seven days; neither shall there any thing of the flesh,
           which thou sacrificedst the first day at even, remain all
           night until the morning.

05:016:005 Thou mayest not sacrifice the passover within any of thy
           gates, which the LORD thy God giveth thee:

05:016:006 But at the place which the LORD thy God shall choose to place
           his name in, there thou shalt sacrifice the passover at even,
           at the going down of the sun, at the season that thou camest
           forth out of Egypt.

05:016:007 And thou shalt roast and eat it in the place which the LORD
           thy God shall choose: and thou shalt turn in the morning, and
           go unto thy tents.

05:016:008 Six days thou shalt eat unleavened bread: and on the seventh
           day shall be a solemn assembly to the LORD thy God: thou shalt
           do no work therein.

05:016:009 Seven weeks shalt thou number unto thee: begin to number the
           seven weeks from such time as thou beginnest to put the sickle
           to the corn.

05:016:010 And thou shalt keep the feast of weeks unto the LORD thy God
           with a tribute of a freewill offering of thine hand, which
           thou shalt give unto the LORD thy God, according as the LORD
           thy God hath blessed thee:

05:016:011 And thou shalt rejoice before the LORD thy God, thou, and thy
           son, and thy daughter, and thy manservant, and thy
           maidservant, and the Levite that is within thy gates, and the
           stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, that are among
           you, in the place which the LORD thy God hath chosen to place
           his name there.

05:016:012 And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt: and
           thou shalt observe and do these statutes.

05:016:013 Thou shalt observe the feast of tabernacles seven days, after
           that thou hast gathered in thy corn and thy wine:

05:016:014 And thou shalt rejoice in thy feast, thou, and thy son, and
           thy daughter, and thy manservant, and thy maidservant, and the
           Levite, the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, that
           are within thy gates.

05:016:015 Seven days shalt thou keep a solemn feast unto the LORD thy
           God in the place which the LORD shall choose: because the LORD
           thy God shall bless thee in all thine increase, and in all the
           works of thine hands, therefore thou shalt surely rejoice.

05:016:016 Three times in a year shall all thy males appear before the
           LORD thy God in the place which he shall choose; in the feast
           of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the
           feast of tabernacles: and they shall not appear before the
           LORD empty:

05:016:017 Every man shall give as he is able, according to the blessing
           of the LORD thy God which he hath given thee.

05:016:018 Judges and officers shalt thou make thee in all thy gates,
           which the LORD thy God giveth thee, throughout thy tribes: and
           they shall judge the people with just judgment.

05:016:019 Thou shalt not wrest judgment; thou shalt not respect persons,
           neither take a gift: for a gift doth blind the eyes of the
           wise, and pervert the words of the righteous.

05:016:020 That which is altogether just shalt thou follow, that thou
           mayest live, and inherit the land which the LORD thy God
           giveth thee.

05:016:021 Thou shalt not plant thee a grove of any trees near unto the
           altar of the LORD thy God, which thou shalt make thee.

05:016:022 Neither shalt thou set thee up any image; which the LORD thy
           God hateth.

05:017:001 Thou shalt not sacrifice unto the LORD thy God any bullock, or
           sheep, wherein is blemish, or any evilfavouredness: for that
           is an abomination unto the LORD thy God.

05:017:002 If there be found among you, within any of thy gates which the
           LORD thy God giveth thee, man or woman, that hath wrought
           wickedness in the sight of the LORD thy God, in transgressing
           his covenant,

05:017:003 And hath gone and served other gods, and worshipped them,
           either the sun, or moon, or any of the host of heaven, which I
           have not commanded;

05:017:004 And it be told thee, and thou hast heard of it, and enquired
           diligently, and, behold, it be true, and the thing certain,
           that such abomination is wrought in Israel:

05:017:005 Then shalt thou bring forth that man or that woman, which have
           committed that wicked thing, unto thy gates, even that man or
           that woman, and shalt stone them with stones, till they die.

05:017:006 At the mouth of two witnesses, or three witnesses, shall he
           that is worthy of death be put to death; but at the mouth of
           one witness he shall not be put to death.

05:017:007 The hands of the witnesses shall be first upon him to put him
           to death, and afterward the hands of all the people. So thou
           shalt put the evil away from among you.

05:017:008 If there arise a matter too hard for thee in judgment, between
           blood and blood, between plea and plea, and between stroke and
           stroke, being matters of controversy within thy gates: then
           shalt thou arise, and get thee up into the place which the
           LORD thy God shall choose;

05:017:009 And thou shalt come unto the priests the Levites, and unto the
           judge that shall be in those days, and enquire; and they shall
           shew thee the sentence of judgment:

05:017:010 And thou shalt do according to the sentence, which they of
           that place which the LORD shall choose shall shew thee; and
           thou shalt observe to do according to all that they inform
           thee:

05:017:011 According to the sentence of the law which they shall teach
           thee, and according to the judgment which they shall tell
           thee, thou shalt do: thou shalt not decline from the sentence
           which they shall shew thee, to the right hand, nor to the
           left.

05:017:012 And the man that will do presumptuously, and will not hearken
           unto the priest that standeth to minister there before the
           LORD thy God, or unto the judge, even that man shall die: and
           thou shalt put away the evil from Israel.

05:017:013 And all the people shall hear, and fear, and do no more
           presumptuously.

05:017:014 When thou art come unto the land which the LORD thy God giveth
           thee, and shalt possess it, and shalt dwell therein, and shalt
           say, I will set a king over me, like as all the nations that
           are about me;

05:017:015 Thou shalt in any wise set him king over thee, whom the LORD
           thy God shall choose: one from among thy brethren shalt thou
           set king over thee: thou mayest not set a stranger over thee,
           which is not thy brother.

05:017:016 But he shall not multiply horses to himself, nor cause the
           people to return to Egypt, to the end that he should multiply
           horses: forasmuch as the LORD hath said unto you, Ye shall
           henceforth return no more that way.

05:017:017 Neither shall he multiply wives to himself, that his heart
           turn not away: neither shall he greatly multiply to himself
           silver and gold.

05:017:018 And it shall be, when he sitteth upon the throne of his
           kingdom, that he shall write him a copy of this law in a book
           out of that which is before the priests the Levites:

05:017:019 And it shall be with him, and he shall read therein all the
           days of his life: that he may learn to fear the LORD his God,
           to keep all the words of this law and these statutes, to do
           them:

05:017:020 That his heart be not lifted up above his brethren, and that
           he turn not aside from the commandment, to the right hand, or
           to the left: to the end that he may prolong his days in his
           kingdom, he, and his children, in the midst of Israel.

05:018:001 The priests the Levites, and all the tribe of Levi, shall have
           no part nor inheritance with Israel: they shall eat the
           offerings of the LORD made by fire, and his inheritance.

05:018:002 Therefore shall they have no inheritance among their brethren:
           the LORD is their inheritance, as he hath said unto them.

05:018:003 And this shall be the priest's due from the people, from them
           that offer a sacrifice, whether it be ox or sheep; and they
           shall give unto the priest the shoulder, and the two cheeks,
           and the maw.

05:018:004 The firstfruit also of thy corn, of thy wine, and of thine
           oil, and the first of the fleece of thy sheep, shalt thou give
           him.

05:018:005 For the LORD thy God hath chosen him out of all thy tribes, to
           stand to minister in the name of the LORD, him and his sons
           for ever.

05:018:006 And if a Levite come from any of thy gates out of all Israel,
           where he sojourned, and come with all the desire of his mind
           unto the place which the LORD shall choose;

05:018:007 Then he shall minister in the name of the LORD his God, as all
           his brethren the Levites do, which stand there before the
           LORD.

05:018:008 They shall have like portions to eat, beside that which cometh
           of the sale of his patrimony.

05:018:009 When thou art come into the land which the LORD thy God giveth
           thee, thou shalt not learn to do after the abominations of
           those nations.

05:018:010 There shall not be found among you any one that maketh his son
           or his daughter to pass through the fire, or that useth
           divination, or an observer of times, or an enchanter, or a
           witch.

05:018:011 Or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar spirits, or a
           wizard, or a necromancer.

05:018:012 For all that do these things are an abomination unto the LORD:
           and because of these abominations the LORD thy God doth drive
           them out from before thee.

05:018:013 Thou shalt be perfect with the LORD thy God.

05:018:014 For these nations, which thou shalt possess, hearkened unto
           observers of times, and unto diviners: but as for thee, the
           LORD thy God hath not suffered thee so to do.

05:018:015 The LORD thy God will raise up unto thee a Prophet from the
           midst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me; unto him ye
           shall hearken;

05:018:016 According to all that thou desiredst of the LORD thy God in
           Horeb in the day of the assembly, saying, Let me not hear
           again the voice of the LORD my God, neither let me see this
           great fire any more, that I die not.

05:018:017 And the LORD said unto me, They have well spoken that which
           they have spoken.

05:018:018 I will raise them up a Prophet from among their brethren, like
           unto thee, and will put my words in his mouth; and he shall
           speak unto them all that I shall command him.

05:018:019 And it shall come to pass, that whosoever will not hearken
           unto my words which he shall speak in my name, I will require
           it of him.

05:018:020 But the prophet, which shall presume to speak a word in my
           name, which I have not commanded him to speak, or that shall
           speak in the name of other gods, even that prophet shall die.

05:018:021 And if thou say in thine heart, How shall we know the word
           which the LORD hath not spoken?

05:018:022 When a prophet speaketh in the name of the LORD, if the thing
           follow not, nor come to pass, that is the thing which the LORD
           hath not spoken, but the prophet hath spoken it
           presumptuously: thou shalt not be afraid of him.

05:019:001 When the LORD thy God hath cut off the nations, whose land the
           LORD thy God giveth thee, and thou succeedest them, and
           dwellest in their cities, and in their houses;

05:019:002 Thou shalt separate three cities for thee in the midst of thy
           land, which the LORD thy God giveth thee to possess it.

05:019:003 Thou shalt prepare thee a way, and divide the coasts of thy
           land, which the LORD thy God giveth thee to inherit, into
           three parts, that every slayer may flee thither.

05:019:004 And this is the case of the slayer, which shall flee thither,
           that he may live: Whoso killeth his neighbour ignorantly, whom
           he hated not in time past;

05:019:005 As when a man goeth into the wood with his neighbour to hew
           wood, and his hand fetcheth a stroke with the axe to cut down
           the tree, and the head slippeth from the helve, and lighteth
           upon his neighbour, that he die; he shall flee unto one of
           those cities, and live:

05:019:006 Lest the avenger of the blood pursue the slayer, while his
           heart is hot, and overtake him, because the way is long, and
           slay him; whereas he was not worthy of death, inasmuch as he
           hated him not in time past.

05:019:007 Wherefore I command thee, saying, Thou shalt separate three
           cities for thee.

05:019:008 And if the LORD thy God enlarge thy coast, as he hath sworn
           unto thy fathers, and give thee all the land which he promised
           to give unto thy fathers;

05:019:009 If thou shalt keep all these commandments to do them, which I
           command thee this day, to love the LORD thy God, and to walk
           ever in his ways; then shalt thou add three cities more for
           thee, beside these three:

05:019:010 That innocent blood be not shed in thy land, which the LORD
           thy God giveth thee for an inheritance, and so blood be upon
           thee.

05:019:011 But if any man hate his neighbour, and lie in wait for him,
           and rise up against him, and smite him mortally that he die,
           and fleeth into one of these cities:

05:019:012 Then the elders of his city shall send and fetch him thence,
           and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood, that he
           may die.

05:019:013 Thine eye shall not pity him, but thou shalt put away the
           guilt of innocent blood from Israel, that it may go well with
           thee.

05:019:014 Thou shalt not remove thy neighbour's landmark, which they of
           old time have set in thine inheritance, which thou shalt
           inherit in the land that the LORD thy God giveth thee to
           possess it.

05:019:015 One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity,
           or for any sin, in any sin that he sinneth: at the mouth of
           two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall the
           matter be established.

05:019:016 If a false witness rise up against any man to testify against
           him that which is wrong;

05:019:017 Then both the men, between whom the controversy is, shall
           stand before the LORD, before the priests and the judges,
           which shall be in those days;

05:019:018 And the judges shall make diligent inquisition: and, behold,
           if the witness be a false witness, and hath testified falsely
           against his brother;

05:019:019 Then shall ye do unto him, as he had thought to have done unto
           his brother: so shalt thou put the evil away from among you.

05:019:020 And those which remain shall hear, and fear, and shall
           henceforth commit no more any such evil among you.

05:019:021 And thine eye shall not pity; but life shall go for life, eye
           for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.

05:020:001 When thou goest out to battle against thine enemies, and seest
           horses, and chariots, and a people more than thou, be not
           afraid of them: for the LORD thy God is with thee, which
           brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.

05:020:002 And it shall be, when ye are come nigh unto the battle, that
           the priest shall approach and speak unto the people,

05:020:003 And shall say unto them, Hear, O Israel, ye approach this day
           unto battle against your enemies: let not your hearts faint,
           fear not, and do not tremble, neither be ye terrified because
           of them;

05:020:004 For the LORD your God is he that goeth with you, to fight for
           you against your enemies, to save you.

05:020:005 And the officers shall speak unto the people, saying, What man
           is there that hath built a new house, and hath not dedicated
           it? let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the
           battle, and another man dedicate it.

05:020:006 And what man is he that hath planted a vineyard, and hath not
           yet eaten of it? let him also go and return unto his house,
           lest he die in the battle, and another man eat of it.

05:020:007 And what man is there that hath betrothed a wife, and hath not
           taken her? let him go and return unto his house, lest he die
           in the battle, and another man take her.

05:020:008 And the officers shall speak further unto the people, and they
           shall say, What man is there that is fearful and fainthearted?
           let him go and return unto his house, lest his brethren's
           heart faint as well as his heart.

05:020:009 And it shall be, when the officers have made an end of
           speaking unto the people that they shall make captains of the
           armies to lead the people.

05:020:010 When thou comest nigh unto a city to fight against it, then
           proclaim peace unto it.

05:020:011 And it shall be, if it make thee answer of peace, and open
           unto thee, then it shall be, that all the people that is found
           therein shall be tributaries unto thee, and they shall serve
           thee.

05:020:012 And if it will make no peace with thee, but will make war
           against thee, then thou shalt besiege it:

05:020:013 And when the LORD thy God hath delivered it into thine hands,
           thou shalt smite every male thereof with the edge of the
           sword:

05:020:014 But the women, and the little ones, and the cattle, and all
           that is in the city, even all the spoil thereof, shalt thou
           take unto thyself; and thou shalt eat the spoil of thine
           enemies, which the LORD thy God hath given thee.

05:020:015 Thus shalt thou do unto all the cities which are very far off
           from thee, which are not of the cities of these nations.

05:020:016 But of the cities of these people, which the LORD thy God doth
           give thee for an inheritance, thou shalt save alive nothing
           that breatheth:

05:020:017 But thou shalt utterly destroy them; namely, the Hittites, and
           the Amorites, the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, the Hivites,
           and the Jebusites; as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee:

05:020:018 That they teach you not to do after all their abominations,
           which they have done unto their gods; so should ye sin against
           the LORD your God.

05:020:019 When thou shalt besiege a city a long time, in making war
           against it to take it, thou shalt not destroy the trees
           thereof by forcing an axe against them: for thou mayest eat of
           them, and thou shalt not cut them down (for the tree of the
           field is man's life) to employ them in the siege:

05:020:020 Only the trees which thou knowest that they be not trees for
           meat, thou shalt destroy and cut them down; and thou shalt
           build bulwarks against the city that maketh war with thee,
           until it be subdued.

05:021:001 If one be found slain in the land which the LORD thy God
           giveth thee to possess it, lying in the field, and it be not
           known who hath slain him:

05:021:002 Then thy elders and thy judges shall come forth, and they
           shall measure unto the cities which are round about him that
           is slain:

05:021:003 And it shall be, that the city which is next unto the slain
           man, even the elders of that city shall take an heifer, which
           hath not been wrought with, and which hath not drawn in the
           yoke;

05:021:004 And the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer unto a
           rough valley, which is neither eared nor sown, and shall
           strike off the heifer's neck there in the valley:

05:021:005 And the priests the sons of Levi shall come near; for them the
           LORD thy God hath chosen to minister unto him, and to bless in
           the name of the LORD; and by their word shall every
           controversy and every stroke be tried:

05:021:006 And all the elders of that city, that are next unto the slain
           man, shall wash their hands over the heifer that is beheaded
           in the valley:

05:021:007 And they shall answer and say, Our hands have not shed this
           blood, neither have our eyes seen it.

05:021:008 Be merciful, O LORD, unto thy people Israel, whom thou hast
           redeemed, and lay not innocent blood unto thy people of
           Israel's charge. And the blood shall be forgiven them.

05:021:009 So shalt thou put away the guilt of innocent blood from among
           you, when thou shalt do that which is right in the sight of
           the LORD.

05:021:010 When thou goest forth to war against thine enemies, and the
           LORD thy God hath delivered them into thine hands, and thou
           hast taken them captive,

05:021:011 And seest among the captives a beautiful woman, and hast a
           desire unto her, that thou wouldest have her to thy wife;

05:021:012 Then thou shalt bring her home to thine house, and she shall
           shave her head, and pare her nails;

05:021:013 And she shall put the raiment of her captivity from off her,
           and shall remain in thine house, and bewail her father and her
           mother a full month: and after that thou shalt go in unto her,
           and be her husband, and she shall be thy wife.

05:021:014 And it shall be, if thou have no delight in her, then thou
           shalt let her go whither she will; but thou shalt not sell her
           at all for money, thou shalt not make merchandise of her,
           because thou hast humbled her.

05:021:015 If a man have two wives, one beloved, and another hated, and
           they have born him children, both the beloved and the hated;
           and if the firstborn son be hers that was hated:

05:021:016 Then it shall be, when he maketh his sons to inherit that
           which he hath, that he may not make the son of the beloved
           firstborn before the son of the hated, which is indeed the
           firstborn:

05:021:017 But he shall acknowledge the son of the hated for the
           firstborn, by giving him a double portion of all that he hath:
           for he is the beginning of his strength; the right of the
           firstborn is his.

05:021:018 If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, which will not
           obey the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and
           that, when they have chastened him, will not hearken unto
           them:

05:021:019 Then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him, and
           bring him out unto the elders of his city, and unto the gate
           of his place;

05:021:020 And they shall say unto the elders of his city, This our son
           is stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voice; he is
           a glutton, and a drunkard.

05:021:021 And all the men of his city shall stone him with stones, that
           he die: so shalt thou put evil away from among you; and all
           Israel shall hear, and fear.

05:021:022 And if a man have committed a sin worthy of death, and he be
           to be put to death, and thou hang him on a tree:

05:021:023 His body shall not remain all night upon the tree, but thou
           shalt in any wise bury him that day; (for he that is hanged is
           accursed of God;) that thy land be not defiled, which the LORD
           thy God giveth thee for an inheritance.

05:022:001 Thou shalt not see thy brother's ox or his sheep go astray,
           and hide thyself from them: thou shalt in any case bring them
           again unto thy brother.

05:022:002 And if thy brother be not nigh unto thee, or if thou know him
           not, then thou shalt bring it unto thine own house, and it
           shall be with thee until thy brother seek after it, and thou
           shalt restore it to him again.

05:022:003 In like manner shalt thou do with his ass; and so shalt thou
           do with his raiment; and with all lost thing of thy brother's,
           which he hath lost, and thou hast found, shalt thou do
           likewise: thou mayest not hide thyself.

05:022:004 Thou shalt not see thy brother's ass or his ox fall down by
           the way, and hide thyself from them: thou shalt surely help
           him to lift them up again.

05:022:005 The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man,
           neither shall a man put on a woman's garment: for all that do
           so are abomination unto the LORD thy God.

05:022:006 If a bird's nest chance to be before thee in the way in any
           tree, or on the ground, whether they be young ones, or eggs,
           and the dam sitting upon the young, or upon the eggs, thou
           shalt not take the dam with the young:

05:022:007 But thou shalt in any wise let the dam go, and take the young
           to thee; that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest
           prolong thy days.

05:022:008 When thou buildest a new house, then thou shalt make a
           battlement for thy roof, that thou bring not blood upon thine
           house, if any man fall from thence.

05:022:009 Thou shalt not sow thy vineyard with divers seeds: lest the
           fruit of thy seed which thou hast sown, and the fruit of thy
           vineyard, be defiled.

05:022:010 Thou shalt not plow with an ox and an ass together.

05:022:011 Thou shalt not wear a garment of divers sorts, as of woollen
           and linen together.

05:022:012 Thou shalt make thee fringes upon the four quarters of thy
           vesture, wherewith thou coverest thyself.

05:022:013 If any man take a wife, and go in unto her, and hate her,

05:022:014 And give occasions of speech against her, and bring up an evil
           name upon her, and say, I took this woman, and when I came to
           her, I found her not a maid:

05:022:015 Then shall the father of the damsel, and her mother, take and
           bring forth the tokens of the damsel's virginity unto the
           elders of the city in the gate:

05:022:016 And the damsel's father shall say unto the elders, I gave my
           daughter unto this man to wife, and he hateth her;

05:022:017 And, lo, he hath given occasions of speech against her,
           saying, I found not thy daughter a maid; and yet these are the
           tokens of my daughter's virginity. And they shall spread the
           cloth before the elders of the city.

05:022:018 And the elders of that city shall take that man and chastise
           him;

05:022:019 And they shall amerce him in an hundred shekels of silver, and
           give them unto the father of the damsel, because he hath
           brought up an evil name upon a virgin of Israel: and she shall
           be his wife; he may not put her away all his days.

05:022:020 But if this thing be true, and the tokens of virginity be not
           found for the damsel:

05:022:021 Then they shall bring out the damsel to the door of her
           father's house, and the men of her city shall stone her with
           stones that she die: because she hath wrought folly in Israel,
           to play the whore in her father's house: so shalt thou put
           evil away from among you.

05:022:022 If a man be found lying with a woman married to an husband,
           then they shall both of them die, both the man that lay with
           the woman, and the woman: so shalt thou put away evil from
           Israel.

05:022:023 If a damsel that is a virgin be betrothed unto an husband, and
           a man find her in the city, and lie with her;

05:022:024 Then ye shall bring them both out unto the gate of that city,
           and ye shall stone them with stones that they die; the damsel,
           because she cried not, being in the city; and the man, because
           he hath humbled his neighbour's wife: so thou shalt put away
           evil from among you.

05:022:025 But if a man find a betrothed damsel in the field, and the man
           force her, and lie with her: then the man only that lay with
           her shall die.

05:022:026 But unto the damsel thou shalt do nothing; there is in the
           damsel no sin worthy of death: for as when a man riseth
           against his neighbour, and slayeth him, even so is this
           matter:

05:022:027 For he found her in the field, and the betrothed damsel cried,
           and there was none to save her.

05:022:028 If a man find a damsel that is a virgin, which is not
           betrothed, and lay hold on her, and lie with her, and they be
           found;

05:022:029 Then the man that lay with her shall give unto the damsel's
           father fifty shekels of silver, and she shall be his wife;
           because he hath humbled her, he may not put her away all his
           days.

05:022:030 A man shall not take his father's wife, nor discover his
           father's skirt.

05:023:001 He that is wounded in the stones, or hath his privy member cut
           off, shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD.

05:023:002 A bastard shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD;
           even to his tenth generation shall he not enter into the
           congregation of the LORD.

05:023:003 An Ammonite or Moabite shall not enter into the congregation
           of the LORD; even to their tenth generation shall they not
           enter into the congregation of the LORD for ever:

05:023:004 Because they met you not with bread and with water in the way,
           when ye came forth out of Egypt; and because they hired
           against thee Balaam the son of Beor of Pethor of Mesopotamia,
           to curse thee.

05:023:005 Nevertheless the LORD thy God would not hearken unto Balaam;
           but the LORD thy God turned the curse into a blessing unto
           thee, because the LORD thy God loved thee.

05:023:006 Thou shalt not seek their peace nor their prosperity all thy
           days for ever.

05:023:007 Thou shalt not abhor an Edomite; for he is thy brother: thou
           shalt not abhor an Egyptian; because thou wast a stranger in
           his land.

05:023:008 The children that are begotten of them shall enter into the
           congregation of the LORD in their third generation.

05:023:009 When the host goeth forth against thine enemies, then keep
           thee from every wicked thing.

05:023:010 If there be among you any man, that is not clean by reason of
           uncleanness that chanceth him by night, then shall he go
           abroad out of the camp, he shall not come within the camp:

05:023:011 But it shall be, when evening cometh on, he shall wash himself
           with water: and when the sun is down, he shall come into the
           camp again.

05:023:012 Thou shalt have a place also without the camp, whither thou
           shalt go forth abroad:

05:023:013 And thou shalt have a paddle upon thy weapon; and it shall be,
           when thou wilt ease thyself abroad, thou shalt dig therewith,
           and shalt turn back and cover that which cometh from thee:

05:023:014 For the LORD thy God walketh in the midst of thy camp, to
           deliver thee, and to give up thine enemies before thee;
           therefore shall thy camp be holy: that he see no unclean thing
           in thee, and turn away from thee.

05:023:015 Thou shalt not deliver unto his master the servant which is
           escaped from his master unto thee:

05:023:016 He shall dwell with thee, even among you, in that place which
           he shall choose in one of thy gates, where it liketh him best:
           thou shalt not oppress him.

05:023:017 There shall be no whore of the daughters of Israel, nor a
           sodomite of the sons of Israel.

05:023:018 Thou shalt not bring the hire of a whore, or the price of a
           dog, into the house of the LORD thy God for any vow: for even
           both these are abomination unto the LORD thy God.

05:023:019 Thou shalt not lend upon usury to thy brother; usury of money,
           usury of victuals, usury of any thing that is lent upon usury:

05:023:020 Unto a stranger thou mayest lend upon usury; but unto thy
           brother thou shalt not lend upon usury: that the LORD thy God
           may bless thee in all that thou settest thine hand to in the
           land whither thou goest to possess it.

05:023:021 When thou shalt vow a vow unto the LORD thy God, thou shalt
           not slack to pay it: for the LORD thy God will surely require
           it of thee; and it would be sin in thee.

05:023:022 But if thou shalt forbear to vow, it shall be no sin in thee.

05:023:023 That which is gone out of thy lips thou shalt keep and
           perform; even a freewill offering, according as thou hast
           vowed unto the LORD thy God, which thou hast promised with thy
           mouth.

05:023:024 When thou comest into thy neighbour's vineyard, then thou
           mayest eat grapes thy fill at thine own pleasure; but thou
           shalt not put any in thy vessel.

05:023:025 When thou comest into the standing corn of thy neighbour, then
           thou mayest pluck the ears with thine hand; but thou shalt not
           move a sickle unto thy neighbour's standing corn.

05:024:001 When a man hath taken a wife, and married her, and it come to
           pass that she find no favour in his eyes, because he hath
           found some uncleanness in her: then let him write her a bill
           of divorcement, and give it in her hand, and send her out of
           his house.

05:024:002 And when she is departed out of his house, she may go and be
           another man's wife.

05:024:003 And if the latter husband hate her, and write her a bill of
           divorcement, and giveth it in her hand, and sendeth her out of
           his house; or if the latter husband die, which took her to be
           his wife;

05:024:004 Her former husband, which sent her away, may not take her
           again to be his wife, after that she is defiled; for that is
           abomination before the LORD: and thou shalt not cause the land
           to sin, which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance.

05:024:005 When a man hath taken a new wife, he shall not go out to war,
           neither shall he be charged with any business: but he shall be
           free at home one year, and shall cheer up his wife which he
           hath taken.

05:024:006 No man shall take the nether or the upper millstone to pledge:
           for he taketh a man's life to pledge.

05:024:007 If a man be found stealing any of his brethren of the children
           of Israel, and maketh merchandise of him, or selleth him; then
           that thief shall die; and thou shalt put evil away from among
           you.

05:024:008 Take heed in the plague of leprosy, that thou observe
           diligently, and do according to all that the priests the
           Levites shall teach you: as I commanded them, so ye shall
           observe to do.

05:024:009 Remember what the LORD thy God did unto Miriam by the way,
           after that ye were come forth out of Egypt.

05:024:010 When thou dost lend thy brother any thing, thou shalt not go
           into his house to fetch his pledge.

05:024:011 Thou shalt stand abroad, and the man to whom thou dost lend
           shall bring out the pledge abroad unto thee.

05:024:012 And if the man be poor, thou shalt not sleep with his pledge:

05:024:013 In any case thou shalt deliver him the pledge again when the
           sun goeth down, that he may sleep in his own raiment, and
           bless thee: and it shall be righteousness unto thee before the
           LORD thy God.

05:024:014 Thou shalt not oppress an hired servant that is poor and
           needy, whether he be of thy brethren, or of thy strangers that
           are in thy land within thy gates:

05:024:015 At his day thou shalt give him his hire, neither shall the sun
           go down upon it; for he is poor, and setteth his heart upon
           it: lest he cry against thee unto the LORD, and it be sin unto
           thee.

05:024:016 The fathers shall not be put to death for the children,
           neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers:
           every man shall be put to death for his own sin.

05:024:017 Thou shalt not pervert the judgment of the stranger, nor of
           the fatherless; nor take a widow's raiment to pledge:

05:024:018 But thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt, and
           the LORD thy God redeemed thee thence: therefore I command
           thee to do this thing.

05:024:019 When thou cuttest down thine harvest in thy field, and hast
           forgot a sheaf in the field, thou shalt not go again to fetch
           it: it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for
           the widow: that the LORD thy God may bless thee in all the
           work of thine hands.

05:024:020 When thou beatest thine olive tree, thou shalt not go over the
           boughs again: it shall be for the stranger, for the
           fatherless, and for the widow.

05:024:021 When thou gatherest the grapes of thy vineyard, thou shalt not
           glean it afterward: it shall be for the stranger, for the
           fatherless, and for the widow.

05:024:022 And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land
           of Egypt: therefore I command thee to do this thing.

05:025:001 If there be a controversy between men, and they come unto
           judgment, that the judges may judge them; then they shall
           justify the righteous, and condemn the wicked.

05:025:002 And it shall be, if the wicked man be worthy to be beaten,
           that the judge shall cause him to lie down, and to be beaten
           before his face, according to his fault, by a certain number.

05:025:003 Forty stripes he may give him, and not exceed: lest, if he
           should exceed, and beat him above these with many stripes,
           then thy brother should seem vile unto thee.

05:025:004 Thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out the corn.

05:025:005 If brethren dwell together, and one of them die, and have no
           child, the wife of the dead shall not marry without unto a
           stranger: her husband's brother shall go in unto her, and take
           her to him to wife, and perform the duty of an husband's
           brother unto her.

05:025:006 And it shall be, that the firstborn which she beareth shall
           succeed in the name of his brother which is dead, that his
           name be not put out of Israel.

05:025:007 And if the man like not to take his brother's wife, then let
           his brother's wife go up to the gate unto the elders, and say,
           My husband's brother refuseth to raise up unto his brother a
           name in Israel, he will not perform the duty of my husband's
           brother.

05:025:008 Then the elders of his city shall call him, and speak unto
           him: and if he stand to it, and say, I like not to take her;

05:025:009 Then shall his brother's wife come unto him in the presence of
           the elders, and loose his shoe from off his foot, and spit in
           his face, and shall answer and say, So shall it be done unto
           that man that will not build up his brother's house.

05:025:010 And his name shall be called in Israel, The house of him that
           hath his shoe loosed.

05:025:011 When men strive together one with another, and the wife of the
           one draweth near for to deliver her husband out of the hand of
           him that smiteth him, and putteth forth her hand, and taketh
           him by the secrets:

05:025:012 Then thou shalt cut off her hand, thine eye shall not pity
           her.

05:025:013 Thou shalt not have in thy bag divers weights, a great and a
           small.

05:025:014 Thou shalt not have in thine house divers measures, a great
           and a small.

05:025:015 But thou shalt have a perfect and just weight, a perfect and
           just measure shalt thou have: that thy days may be lengthened
           in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.

05:025:016 For all that do such things, and all that do unrighteously,
           are an abomination unto the LORD thy God.

05:025:017 Remember what Amalek did unto thee by the way, when ye were
           come forth out of Egypt;

05:025:018 How he met thee by the way, and smote the hindmost of thee,
           even all that were feeble behind thee, when thou wast faint
           and weary; and he feared not God.

05:025:019 Therefore it shall be, when the LORD thy God hath given thee
           rest from all thine enemies round about, in the land which the
           LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it,
           that thou shalt blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under
           heaven; thou shalt not forget it.

05:026:001 And it shall be, when thou art come in unto the land which the
           LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance, and possessest
           it, and dwellest therein;

05:026:002 That thou shalt take of the first of all the fruit of the
           earth, which thou shalt bring of thy land that the LORD thy
           God giveth thee, and shalt put it in a basket, and shalt go
           unto the place which the LORD thy God shall choose to place
           his name there.

05:026:003 And thou shalt go unto the priest that shall be in those days,
           and say unto him, I profess this day unto the LORD thy God,
           that I am come unto the country which the LORD sware unto our
           fathers for to give us.

05:026:004 And the priest shall take the basket out of thine hand, and
           set it down before the altar of the LORD thy God.

05:026:005 And thou shalt speak and say before the LORD thy God, A Syrian
           ready to perish was my father, and he went down into Egypt,
           and sojourned there with a few, and became there a nation,
           great, mighty, and populous:

05:026:006 And the Egyptians evil entreated us, and afflicted us, and
           laid upon us hard bondage:

05:026:007 And when we cried unto the LORD God of our fathers, the LORD
           heard our voice, and looked on our affliction, and our labour,
           and our oppression:

05:026:008 And the LORD brought us forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand,
           and with an outstretched arm, and with great terribleness, and
           with signs, and with wonders:

05:026:009 And he hath brought us into this place, and hath given us this
           land, even a land that floweth with milk and honey.

05:026:010 And now, behold, I have brought the firstfruits of the land,
           which thou, O LORD, hast given me. And thou shalt set it
           before the LORD thy God, and worship before the LORD thy God:

05:026:011 And thou shalt rejoice in every good thing which the LORD thy
           God hath given unto thee, and unto thine house, thou, and the
           Levite, and the stranger that is among you.

05:026:012 When thou hast made an end of tithing all the tithes of thine
           increase the third year, which is the year of tithing, and
           hast given it unto the Levite, the stranger, the fatherless,
           and the widow, that they may eat within thy gates, and be
           filled;

05:026:013 Then thou shalt say before the LORD thy God, I have brought
           away the hallowed things out of mine house, and also have
           given them unto the Levite, and unto the stranger, to the
           fatherless, and to the widow, according to all thy
           commandments which thou hast commanded me: I have not
           transgressed thy commandments, neither have I forgotten them.

05:026:014 I have not eaten thereof in my mourning, neither have I taken
           away ought thereof for any unclean use, nor given ought
           thereof for the dead: but I have hearkened to the voice of the
           LORD my God, and have done according to all that thou hast
           commanded me.

05:026:015 Look down from thy holy habitation, from heaven, and bless thy
           people Israel, and the land which thou hast given us, as thou
           swarest unto our fathers, a land that floweth with milk and
           honey.

05:026:016 This day the LORD thy God hath commanded thee to do these
           statutes and judgments: thou shalt therefore keep and do them
           with all thine heart, and with all thy soul.

05:026:017 Thou hast avouched the LORD this day to be thy God, and to
           walk in his ways, and to keep his statutes, and his
           commandments, and his judgments, and to hearken unto his
           voice:

05:026:018 And the LORD hath avouched thee this day to be his peculiar
           people, as he hath promised thee, and that thou shouldest keep
           all his commandments;

05:026:019 And to make thee high above all nations which he hath made, in
           praise, and in name, and in honour; and that thou mayest be an
           holy people unto the LORD thy God, as he hath spoken.

05:027:001 And Moses with the elders of Israel commanded the people,
           saying, Keep all the commandments which I command you this
           day.

05:027:002 And it shall be on the day when ye shall pass over Jordan unto
           the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee, that thou shalt
           set thee up great stones, and plaister them with plaister:

05:027:003 And thou shalt write upon them all the words of this law, when
           thou art passed over, that thou mayest go in unto the land
           which the LORD thy God giveth thee, a land that floweth with
           milk and honey; as the LORD God of thy fathers hath promised
           thee.

05:027:004 Therefore it shall be when ye be gone over Jordan, that ye
           shall set up these stones, which I command you this day, in
           mount Ebal, and thou shalt plaister them with plaister.

05:027:005 And there shalt thou build an altar unto the LORD thy God, an
           altar of stones: thou shalt not lift up any iron tool upon
           them.

05:027:006 Thou shalt build the altar of the LORD thy God of whole
           stones: and thou shalt offer burnt offerings thereon unto the
           LORD thy God:

05:027:007 And thou shalt offer peace offerings, and shalt eat there, and
           rejoice before the LORD thy God.

05:027:008 And thou shalt write upon the stones all the words of this law
           very plainly.

05:027:009 And Moses and the priests the Levites spake unto all Israel,
           saying, Take heed, and hearken, O Israel; this day thou art
           become the people of the LORD thy God.

05:027:010 Thou shalt therefore obey the voice of the LORD thy God, and
           do his commandments and his statutes, which I command thee
           this day.

05:027:011 And Moses charged the people the same day, saying,

05:027:012 These shall stand upon mount Gerizim to bless the people, when
           ye are come over Jordan; Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and
           Issachar, and Joseph, and Benjamin:

05:027:013 And these shall stand upon mount Ebal to curse; Reuben, Gad,
           and Asher, and Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali.

05:027:014 And the Levites shall speak, and say unto all the men of
           Israel with a loud voice,

05:027:015 Cursed be the man that maketh any graven or molten image, an
           abomination unto the LORD, the work of the hands of the
           craftsman, and putteth it in a secret place. And all the
           people shall answer and say, Amen.

05:027:016 Cursed be he that setteth light by his father or his mother.
           And all the people shall say, Amen.

05:027:017 Cursed be he that removeth his neighbour's landmark. And all
           the people shall say, Amen.

05:027:018 Cursed be he that maketh the blind to wander out of the way.
           And all the people shall say, Amen.

05:027:019 Cursed be he that perverteth the judgment of the stranger,
           fatherless, and widow. And all the people shall say, Amen.

05:027:020 Cursed be he that lieth with his father's wife; because he
           uncovereth his father's skirt. And all the people shall say,
           Amen.

05:027:021 Cursed be he that lieth with any manner of beast. And all the
           people shall say, Amen.

05:027:022 Cursed be he that lieth with his sister, the daughter of his
           father, or the daughter of his mother. And all the people
           shall say, Amen.

05:027:023 Cursed be he that lieth with his mother in law. And all the
           people shall say, Amen.

05:027:024 Cursed be he that smiteth his neighbour secretly. And all the
           people shall say, Amen.

05:027:025 Cursed be he that taketh reward to slay an innocent person.
           And all the people shall say, Amen.

05:027:026 Cursed be he that confirmeth not all the words of this law to
           do them. And all the people shall say, Amen.

05:028:001 And it shall come to pass, if thou shalt hearken diligently
           unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to observe and to do all
           his commandments which I command thee this day, that the LORD
           thy God will set thee on high above all nations of the earth:

05:028:002 And all these blessings shall come on thee, and overtake thee,
           if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God.

05:028:003 Blessed shalt thou be in the city, and blessed shalt thou be
           in the field.

05:028:004 Blessed shall be the fruit of thy body, and the fruit of thy
           ground, and the fruit of thy cattle, the increase of thy kine,
           and the flocks of thy sheep.

05:028:005 Blessed shall be thy basket and thy store.

05:028:006 Blessed shalt thou be when thou comest in, and blessed shalt
           thou be when thou goest out.

05:028:007 The LORD shall cause thine enemies that rise up against thee
           to be smitten before thy face: they shall come out against
           thee one way, and flee before thee seven ways.

05:028:008 The LORD shall command the blessing upon thee in thy
           storehouses, and in all that thou settest thine hand unto; and
           he shall bless thee in the land which the LORD thy God giveth
           thee.

05:028:009 The LORD shall establish thee an holy people unto himself, as
           he hath sworn unto thee, if thou shalt keep the commandments
           of the LORD thy God, and walk in his ways.

05:028:010 And all people of the earth shall see that thou art called by
           the name of the LORD; and they shall be afraid of thee.

05:028:011 And the LORD shall make thee plenteous in goods, in the fruit
           of thy body, and in the fruit of thy cattle, and in the fruit
           of thy ground, in the land which the LORD sware unto thy
           fathers to give thee.

05:028:012 The LORD shall open unto thee his good treasure, the heaven to
           give the rain unto thy land in his season, and to bless all
           the work of thine hand: and thou shalt lend unto many nations,
           and thou shalt not borrow.

05:028:013 And the LORD shall make thee the head, and not the tail; and
           thou shalt be above only, and thou shalt not be beneath; if
           that thou hearken unto the commandments of the LORD thy God,
           which I command thee this day, to observe and to do them:

05:028:014 And thou shalt not go aside from any of the words which I
           command thee this day, to the right hand, or to the left, to
           go after other gods to serve them.

05:028:015 But it shall come to pass, if thou wilt not hearken unto the
           voice of the LORD thy God, to observe to do all his
           commandments and his statutes which I command thee this day;
           that all these curses shall come upon thee, and overtake thee:

05:028:016 Cursed shalt thou be in the city, and cursed shalt thou be in
           the field.

05:028:017 Cursed shall be thy basket and thy store.

05:028:018 Cursed shall be the fruit of thy body, and the fruit of thy
           land, the increase of thy kine, and the flocks of thy sheep.

05:028:019 Cursed shalt thou be when thou comest in, and cursed shalt
           thou be when thou goest out.

05:028:020 The LORD shall send upon thee cursing, vexation, and rebuke,
           in all that thou settest thine hand unto for to do, until thou
           be destroyed, and until thou perish quickly; because of the
           wickedness of thy doings, whereby thou hast forsaken me.

05:028:021 The LORD shall make the pestilence cleave unto thee, until he
           have consumed thee from off the land, whither thou goest to
           possess it.

05:028:022 The LORD shall smite thee with a consumption, and with a
           fever, and with an inflammation, and with an extreme burning,
           and with the sword, and with blasting, and with mildew; and
           they shall pursue thee until thou perish.

05:028:023 And thy heaven that is over thy head shall be brass, and the
           earth that is under thee shall be iron.

05:028:024 The LORD shall make the rain of thy land powder and dust: from
           heaven shall it come down upon thee, until thou be destroyed.

05:028:025 The LORD shall cause thee to be smitten before thine enemies:
           thou shalt go out one way against them, and flee seven ways
           before them: and shalt be removed into all the kingdoms of the
           earth.

05:028:026 And thy carcase shall be meat unto all fowls of the air, and
           unto the beasts of the earth, and no man shall fray them away.

05:028:027 The LORD will smite thee with the botch of Egypt, and with the
           emerods, and with the scab, and with the itch, whereof thou
           canst not be healed.

05:028:028 The LORD shall smite thee with madness, and blindness, and
           astonishment of heart:

05:028:029 And thou shalt grope at noonday, as the blind gropeth in
           darkness, and thou shalt not prosper in thy ways: and thou
           shalt be only oppressed and spoiled evermore, and no man shall
           save thee.

05:028:030 Thou shalt betroth a wife, and another man shall lie with her:
           thou shalt build an house, and thou shalt not dwell therein:
           thou shalt plant a vineyard, and shalt not gather the grapes
           thereof.

05:028:031 Thine ox shall be slain before thine eyes, and thou shalt not
           eat thereof: thine ass shall be violently taken away from
           before thy face, and shall not be restored to thee: thy sheep
           shall be given unto thine enemies, and thou shalt have none to
           rescue them.

05:028:032 Thy sons and thy daughters shall be given unto another people,
           and thine eyes shall look, and fail with longing for them all
           the day long; and there shall be no might in thine hand.

05:028:033 The fruit of thy land, and all thy labours, shall a nation
           which thou knowest not eat up; and thou shalt be only
           oppressed and crushed alway:

05:028:034 So that thou shalt be mad for the sight of thine eyes which
           thou shalt see.

05:028:035 The LORD shall smite thee in the knees, and in the legs, with
           a sore botch that cannot be healed, from the sole of thy foot
           unto the top of thy head.

05:028:036 The LORD shall bring thee, and thy king which thou shalt set
           over thee, unto a nation which neither thou nor thy fathers
           have known; and there shalt thou serve other gods, wood and
           stone.

05:028:037 And thou shalt become an astonishment, a proverb, and a
           byword, among all nations whither the LORD shall lead thee.

05:028:038 Thou shalt carry much seed out into the field, and shalt
           gather but little in; for the locust shall consume it.

05:028:039 Thou shalt plant vineyards, and dress them, but shalt neither
           drink of the wine, nor gather the grapes; for the worms shall
           eat them.

05:028:040 Thou shalt have olive trees throughout all thy coasts, but
           thou shalt not anoint thyself with the oil; for thine olive
           shall cast his fruit.

05:028:041 Thou shalt beget sons and daughters, but thou shalt not enjoy
           them; for they shall go into captivity.

05:028:042 All thy trees and fruit of thy land shall the locust consume.

05:028:043 The stranger that is within thee shall get up above thee very
           high; and thou shalt come down very low.

05:028:044 He shall lend to thee, and thou shalt not lend to him: he
           shall be the head, and thou shalt be the tail.

05:028:045 Moreover all these curses shall come upon thee, and shall
           pursue thee, and overtake thee, till thou be destroyed;
           because thou hearkenedst not unto the voice of the LORD thy
           God, to keep his commandments and his statutes which he
           commanded thee:

05:028:046 And they shall be upon thee for a sign and for a wonder, and
           upon thy seed for ever.

05:028:047 Because thou servedst not the LORD thy God with joyfulness,
           and with gladness of heart, for the abundance of all things;

05:028:048 Therefore shalt thou serve thine enemies which the LORD shall
           send against thee, in hunger, and in thirst, and in nakedness,
           and in want of all things: and he shall put a yoke of iron
           upon thy neck, until he have destroyed thee.

05:028:049 The LORD shall bring a nation against thee from far, from the
           end of the earth, as swift as the eagle flieth; a nation whose
           tongue thou shalt not understand;

05:028:050 A nation of fierce countenance, which shall not regard the
           person of the old, nor shew favour to the young:

05:028:051 And he shall eat the fruit of thy cattle, and the fruit of thy
           land, until thou be destroyed: which also shall not leave thee
           either corn, wine, or oil, or the increase of thy kine, or
           flocks of thy sheep, until he have destroyed thee.

05:028:052 And he shall besiege thee in all thy gates, until thy high and
           fenced walls come down, wherein thou trustedst, throughout all
           thy land: and he shall besiege thee in all thy gates
           throughout all thy land, which the LORD thy God hath given
           thee.

05:028:053 And thou shalt eat the fruit of thine own body, the flesh of
           thy sons and of thy daughters, which the LORD thy God hath
           given thee, in the siege, and in the straitness, wherewith
           thine enemies shall distress thee:

05:028:054 So that the man that is tender among you, and very delicate,
           his eye shall be evil toward his brother, and toward the wife
           of his bosom, and toward the remnant of his children which he
           shall leave:

05:028:055 So that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his
           children whom he shall eat: because he hath nothing left him
           in the siege, and in the straitness, wherewith thine enemies
           shall distress thee in all thy gates.

05:028:056 The tender and delicate woman among you, which would not
           adventure to set the sole of her foot upon the ground for
           delicateness and tenderness, her eye shall be evil toward the
           husband of her bosom, and toward her son, and toward her
           daughter,

05:028:057 And toward her young one that cometh out from between her
           feet, and toward her children which she shall bear: for she
           shall eat them for want of all things secretly in the siege
           and straitness, wherewith thine enemy shall distress thee in
           thy gates.

05:028:058 If thou wilt not observe to do all the words of this law that
           are written in this book, that thou mayest fear this glorious
           and fearful name, THE LORD THY GOD;

05:028:059 Then the LORD will make thy plagues wonderful, and the plagues
           of thy seed, even great plagues, and of long continuance, and
           sore sicknesses, and of long continuance.

05:028:060 Moreover he will bring upon thee all the diseases of Egypt,
           which thou wast afraid of; and they shall cleave unto thee.

05:028:061 Also every sickness, and every plague, which is not written in
           the book of this law, them will the LORD bring upon thee,
           until thou be destroyed.

05:028:062 And ye shall be left few in number, whereas ye were as the
           stars of heaven for multitude; because thou wouldest not obey
           the voice of the LORD thy God.

05:028:063 And it shall come to pass, that as the LORD rejoiced over you
           to do you good, and to multiply you; so the LORD will rejoice
           over you to destroy you, and to bring you to nought; and ye
           shall be plucked from off the land whither thou goest to
           possess it.

05:028:064 And the LORD shall scatter thee among all people, from the one
           end of the earth even unto the other; and there thou shalt
           serve other gods, which neither thou nor thy fathers have
           known, even wood and stone.

05:028:065 And among these nations shalt thou find no ease, neither shall
           the sole of thy foot have rest: but the LORD shall give thee
           there a trembling heart, and failing of eyes, and sorrow of
           mind:

05:028:066 And thy life shall hang in doubt before thee; and thou shalt
           fear day and night, and shalt have none assurance of thy life:

05:028:067 In the morning thou shalt say, Would God it were even! and at
           even thou shalt say, Would God it were morning! for the fear
           of thine heart wherewith thou shalt fear, and for the sight of
           thine eyes which thou shalt see.

05:028:068 And the LORD shall bring thee into Egypt again with ships, by
           the way whereof I spake unto thee, Thou shalt see it no more
           again: and there ye shall be sold unto your enemies for
           bondmen and bondwomen, and no man shall buy you.

05:029:001 These are the words of the covenant, which the LORD commanded
           Moses to make with the children of Israel in the land of Moab,
           beside the covenant which he made with them in Horeb.

05:029:002 And Moses called unto all Israel, and said unto them, Ye have
           seen all that the LORD did before your eyes in the land of
           Egypt unto Pharaoh, and unto all his servants, and unto all
           his land;

05:029:003 The great temptations which thine eyes have seen, the signs,
           and those great miracles:

05:029:004 Yet the LORD hath not given you an heart to perceive, and eyes
           to see, and ears to hear, unto this day.

05:029:005 And I have led you forty years in the wilderness: your clothes
           are not waxen old upon you, and thy shoe is not waxen old upon
           thy foot.

05:029:006 Ye have not eaten bread, neither have ye drunk wine or strong
           drink: that ye might know that I am the LORD your God.

05:029:007 And when ye came unto this place, Sihon the king of Heshbon,
           and Og the king of Bashan, came out against us unto battle,
           and we smote them:

05:029:008 And we took their land, and gave it for an inheritance unto
           the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half tribe of
           Manasseh.

05:029:009 Keep therefore the words of this covenant, and do them, that
           ye may prosper in all that ye do.

05:029:010 Ye stand this day all of you before the LORD your God; your
           captains of your tribes, your elders, and your officers, with
           all the men of Israel,

05:029:011 Your little ones, your wives, and thy stranger that is in thy
           camp, from the hewer of thy wood unto the drawer of thy water:

05:029:012 That thou shouldest enter into covenant with the LORD thy God,
           and into his oath, which the LORD thy God maketh with thee
           this day:

05:029:013 That he may establish thee to day for a people unto himself,
           and that he may be unto thee a God, as he hath said unto thee,
           and as he hath sworn unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac,
           and to Jacob.

05:029:014 Neither with you only do I make this covenant and this oath;

05:029:015 But with him that standeth here with us this day before the
           LORD our God, and also with him that is not here with us this
           day:

05:029:016 (For ye know how we have dwelt in the land of Egypt; and how
           we came through the nations which ye passed by;

05:029:017 And ye have seen their abominations, and their idols, wood and
           stone, silver and gold, which were among them:)

05:029:018 Lest there should be among you man, or woman, or family, or
           tribe, whose heart turneth away this day from the LORD our
           God, to go and serve the gods of these nations; lest there
           should be among you a root that beareth gall and wormwood;

05:029:019 And it come to pass, when he heareth the words of this curse,
           that he bless himself in his heart, saying, I shall have
           peace, though I walk in the imagination of mine heart, to add
           drunkenness to thirst:

05:029:020 The LORD will not spare him, but then the anger of the LORD
           and his jealousy shall smoke against that man, and all the
           curses that are written in this book shall lie upon him, and
           the LORD shall blot out his name from under heaven.

05:029:021 And the LORD shall separate him unto evil out of all the
           tribes of Israel, according to all the curses of the covenant
           that are written in this book of the law:

05:029:022 So that the generation to come of your children that shall
           rise up after you, and the stranger that shall come from a far
           land, shall say, when they see the plagues of that land, and
           the sicknesses which the LORD hath laid upon it;

05:029:023 And that the whole land thereof is brimstone, and salt, and
           burning, that it is not sown, nor beareth, nor any grass
           groweth therein, like the overthrow of Sodom, and Gomorrah,
           Admah, and Zeboim, which the LORD overthrew in his anger, and
           in his wrath:

05:029:024 Even all nations shall say, Wherefore hath the LORD done thus
           unto this land? what meaneth the heat of this great anger?

05:029:025 Then men shall say, Because they have forsaken the covenant of
           the LORD God of their fathers, which he made with them when he
           brought them forth out of the land of Egypt:

05:029:026 For they went and served other gods, and worshipped them, gods
           whom they knew not, and whom he had not given unto them:

05:029:027 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against this land, to
           bring upon it all the curses that are written in this book:

05:029:028 And the LORD rooted them out of their land in anger, and in
           wrath, and in great indignation, and cast them into another
           land, as it is this day.

05:029:029 The secret things belong unto the LORD our God: but those
           things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children
           for ever, that we may do all the words of this law.

05:030:001 And it shall come to pass, when all these things are come upon
           thee, the blessing and the curse, which I have set before
           thee, and thou shalt call them to mind among all the nations,
           whither the LORD thy God hath driven thee,

05:030:002 And shalt return unto the LORD thy God, and shalt obey his
           voice according to all that I command thee this day, thou and
           thy children, with all thine heart, and with all thy soul;

05:030:003 That then the LORD thy God will turn thy captivity, and have
           compassion upon thee, and will return and gather thee from all
           the nations, whither the LORD thy God hath scattered thee.

05:030:004 If any of thine be driven out unto the outmost parts of
           heaven, from thence will the LORD thy God gather thee, and
           from thence will he fetch thee:

05:030:005 And the LORD thy God will bring thee into the land which thy
           fathers possessed, and thou shalt possess it; and he will do
           thee good, and multiply thee above thy fathers.

05:030:006 And the LORD thy God will circumcise thine heart, and the
           heart of thy seed, to love the LORD thy God with all thine
           heart, and with all thy soul, that thou mayest live.

05:030:007 And the LORD thy God will put all these curses upon thine
           enemies, and on them that hate thee, which persecuted thee.

05:030:008 And thou shalt return and obey the voice of the LORD, and do
           all his commandments which I command thee this day.

05:030:009 And the LORD thy God will make thee plenteous in every work of
           thine hand, in the fruit of thy body, and in the fruit of thy
           cattle, and in the fruit of thy land, for good: for the LORD
           will again rejoice over thee for good, as he rejoiced over thy
           fathers:

05:030:010 If thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to
           keep his commandments and his statutes which are written in
           this book of the law, and if thou turn unto the LORD thy God
           with all thine heart, and with all thy soul.

05:030:011 For this commandment which I command thee this day, it is not
           hidden from thee, neither is it far off.

05:030:012 It is not in heaven, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go up
           for us to heaven, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it,
           and do it?

05:030:013 Neither is it beyond the sea, that thou shouldest say, Who
           shall go over the sea for us, and bring it unto us, that we
           may hear it, and do it?

05:030:014 But the word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth, and in thy
           heart, that thou mayest do it.

05:030:015 See, I have set before thee this day life and good, and death
           and evil;

05:030:016 In that I command thee this day to love the LORD thy God, to
           walk in his ways, and to keep his commandments and his
           statutes and his judgments, that thou mayest live and
           multiply: and the LORD thy God shall bless thee in the land
           whither thou goest to possess it.

05:030:017 But if thine heart turn away, so that thou wilt not hear, but
           shalt be drawn away, and worship other gods, and serve them;

05:030:018 I denounce unto you this day, that ye shall surely perish, and
           that ye shall not prolong your days upon the land, whither
           thou passest over Jordan to go to possess it.

05:030:019 I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, that I
           have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing:
           therefore choose life, that both thou and thy seed may live:

05:030:020 That thou mayest love the LORD thy God, and that thou mayest
           obey his voice, and that thou mayest cleave unto him: for he
           is thy life, and the length of thy days: that thou mayest
           dwell in the land which the LORD sware unto thy fathers, to
           Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give them.

05:031:001 And Moses went and spake these words unto all Israel.

05:031:002 And he said unto them, I am an hundred and twenty years old
           this day; I can no more go out and come in: also the LORD hath
           said unto me, Thou shalt not go over this Jordan.

05:031:003 The LORD thy God, he will go over before thee, and he will
           destroy these nations from before thee, and thou shalt possess
           them: and Joshua, he shall go over before thee, as the LORD
           hath said.

05:031:004 And the LORD shall do unto them as he did to Sihon and to Og,
           kings of the Amorites, and unto the land of them, whom he
           destroyed.

05:031:005 And the LORD shall give them up before your face, that ye may
           do unto them according unto all the commandments which I have
           commanded you.

05:031:006 Be strong and of a good courage, fear not, nor be afraid of
           them: for the LORD thy God, he it is that doth go with thee;
           he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.

05:031:007 And Moses called unto Joshua, and said unto him in the sight
           of all Israel, Be strong and of a good courage: for thou must
           go with this people unto the land which the LORD hath sworn
           unto their fathers to give them; and thou shalt cause them to
           inherit it.

05:031:008 And the LORD, he it is that doth go before thee; he will be
           with thee, he will not fail thee, neither forsake thee: fear
           not, neither be dismayed.

05:031:009 And Moses wrote this law, and delivered it unto the priests
           the sons of Levi, which bare the ark of the covenant of the
           LORD, and unto all the elders of Israel.

05:031:010 And Moses commanded them, saying, At the end of every seven
           years, in the solemnity of the year of release, in the feast
           of tabernacles,

05:031:011 When all Israel is come to appear before the LORD thy God in
           the place which he shall choose, thou shalt read this law
           before all Israel in their hearing.

05:031:012 Gather the people together, men and women, and children, and
           thy stranger that is within thy gates, that they may hear, and
           that they may learn, and fear the LORD your God, and observe
           to do all the words of this law:

05:031:013 And that their children, which have not known any thing, may
           hear, and learn to fear the LORD your God, as long as ye live
           in the land whither ye go over Jordan to possess it.

05:031:014 And the LORD said unto Moses, Behold, thy days approach that
           thou must die: call Joshua, and present yourselves in the
           tabernacle of the congregation, that I may give him a charge.
           And Moses and Joshua went, and presented themselves in the
           tabernacle of the congregation.

05:031:015 And the LORD appeared in the tabernacle in a pillar of a
           cloud: and the pillar of the cloud stood over the door of the
           tabernacle.

05:031:016 And the LORD said unto Moses, Behold, thou shalt sleep with
           thy fathers; and this people will rise up, and go a whoring
           after the gods of the strangers of the land, whither they go
           to be among them, and will forsake me, and break my covenant
           which I have made with them.

05:031:017 Then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I
           will forsake them, and I will hide my face from them, and they
           shall be devoured, and many evils and troubles shall befall
           them; so that they will say in that day, Are not these evils
           come upon us, because our God is not among us?

05:031:018 And I will surely hide my face in that day for all the evils
           which they shall have wrought, in that they are turned unto
           other gods.

05:031:019 Now therefore write ye this song for you, and teach it the
           children of Israel: put it in their mouths, that this song may
           be a witness for me against the children of Israel.

05:031:020 For when I shall have brought them into the land which I sware
           unto their fathers, that floweth with milk and honey; and they
           shall have eaten and filled themselves, and waxen fat; then
           will they turn unto other gods, and serve them, and provoke
           me, and break my covenant.

05:031:021 And it shall come to pass, when many evils and troubles are
           befallen them, that this song shall testify against them as a
           witness; for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of
           their seed: for I know their imagination which they go about,
           even now, before I have brought them into the land which I
           sware.

05:031:022 Moses therefore wrote this song the same day, and taught it
           the children of Israel.

05:031:023 And he gave Joshua the son of Nun a charge, and said, Be
           strong and of a good courage: for thou shalt bring the
           children of Israel into the land which I sware unto them: and
           I will be with thee.

05:031:024 And it came to pass, when Moses had made an end of writing the
           words of this law in a book, until they were finished,

05:031:025 That Moses commanded the Levites, which bare the ark of the
           covenant of the LORD, saying,

05:031:026 Take this book of the law, and put it in the side of the ark
           of the covenant of the LORD your God, that it may be there for
           a witness against thee.

05:031:027 For I know thy rebellion, and thy stiff neck: behold, while I
           am yet alive with you this day, ye have been rebellious
           against the LORD; and how much more after my death?

05:031:028 Gather unto me all the elders of your tribes, and your
           officers, that I may speak these words in their ears, and call
           heaven and earth to record against them.

05:031:029 For I know that after my death ye will utterly corrupt
           yourselves, and turn aside from the way which I have commanded
           you; and evil will befall you in the latter days; because ye
           will do evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger
           through the work of your hands.

05:031:030 And Moses spake in the ears of all the congregation of Israel
           the words of this song, until they were ended.

05:032:001 Give ear, O ye heavens, and I will speak; and hear, O earth,
           the words of my mouth.

05:032:002 My doctrine shall drop as the rain, my speech shall distil as
           the dew, as the small rain upon the tender herb, and as the
           showers upon the grass:

05:032:003 Because I will publish the name of the LORD: ascribe ye
           greatness unto our God.

05:032:004 He is the Rock, his work is perfect: for all his ways are
           judgment: a God of truth and without iniquity, just and right
           is he.

05:032:005 They have corrupted themselves, their spot is not the spot of
           his children: they are a perverse and crooked generation.

05:032:006 Do ye thus requite the LORD, O foolish people and unwise? is
           not he thy father that hath bought thee? hath he not made
           thee, and established thee?

05:032:007 Remember the days of old, consider the years of many
           generations: ask thy father, and he will shew thee; thy
           elders, and they will tell thee.

05:032:008 When the Most High divided to the nations their inheritance,
           when he separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the
           people according to the number of the children of Israel.

05:032:009 For the LORD's portion is his people; Jacob is the lot of his
           inheritance.

05:032:010 He found him in a desert land, and in the waste howling
           wilderness; he led him about, he instructed him, he kept him
           as the apple of his eye.

05:032:011 As an eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young,
           spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her
           wings:

05:032:012 So the LORD alone did lead him, and there was no strange god
           with him.

05:032:013 He made him ride on the high places of the earth, that he
           might eat the increase of the fields; and he made him to suck
           honey out of the rock, and oil out of the flinty rock;

05:032:014 Butter of kine, and milk of sheep, with fat of lambs, and rams
           of the breed of Bashan, and goats, with the fat of kidneys of
           wheat; and thou didst drink the pure blood of the grape.

05:032:015 But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked: thou art waxen fat, thou
           art grown thick, thou art covered with fatness; then he
           forsook God which made him, and lightly esteemed the Rock of
           his salvation.

05:032:016 They provoked him to jealousy with strange gods, with
           abominations provoked they him to anger.

05:032:017 They sacrificed unto devils, not to God; to gods whom they
           knew not, to new gods that came newly up, whom your fathers
           feared not.

05:032:018 Of the Rock that begat thee thou art unmindful, and hast
           forgotten God that formed thee.

05:032:019 And when the LORD saw it, he abhorred them, because of the
           provoking of his sons, and of his daughters.

05:032:020 And he said, I will hide my face from them, I will see what
           their end shall be: for they are a very froward generation,
           children in whom is no faith.

05:032:021 They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God;
           they have provoked me to anger with their vanities: and I will
           move them to jealousy with those which are not a people; I
           will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.

05:032:022 For a fire is kindled in mine anger, and shall burn unto the
           lowest hell, and shall consume the earth with her increase,
           and set on fire the foundations of the mountains.

05:032:023 I will heap mischiefs upon them; I will spend mine arrows upon
           them.

05:032:024 They shall be burnt with hunger, and devoured with burning
           heat, and with bitter destruction: I will also send the teeth
           of beasts upon them, with the poison of serpents of the dust.

05:032:025 The sword without, and terror within, shall destroy both the
           young man and the virgin, the suckling also with the man of
           gray hairs.

05:032:026 I said, I would scatter them into corners, I would make the
           remembrance of them to cease from among men:

05:032:027 Were it not that I feared the wrath of the enemy, lest their
           adversaries should behave themselves strangely, and lest they
           should say, Our hand is high, and the LORD hath not done all
           this.

05:032:028 For they are a nation void of counsel, neither is there any
           understanding in them.

05:032:029 O that they were wise, that they understood this, that they
           would consider their latter end!

05:032:030 How should one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to
           flight, except their Rock had sold them, and the LORD had shut
           them up?

05:032:031 For their rock is not as our Rock, even our enemies themselves
           being judges.

05:032:032 For their vine is of the vine of Sodom, and of the fields of
           Gomorrah: their grapes are grapes of gall, their clusters are
           bitter:

05:032:033 Their wine is the poison of dragons, and the cruel venom of
           asps.

05:032:034 Is not this laid up in store with me, and sealed up among my
           treasures?

05:032:035 To me belongeth vengeance and recompence; their foot shall
           slide in due time: for the day of their calamity is at hand,
           and the things that shall come upon them make haste.

05:032:036 For the LORD shall judge his people, and repent himself for
           his servants, when he seeth that their power is gone, and
           there is none shut up, or left.

05:032:037 And he shall say, Where are their gods, their rock in whom
           they trusted,

05:032:038 Which did eat the fat of their sacrifices, and drank the wine
           of their drink offerings? let them rise up and help you, and
           be your protection.

05:032:039 See now that I, even I, am he, and there is no god with me: I
           kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal: neither is there
           any that can deliver out of my hand.

05:032:040 For I lift up my hand to heaven, and say, I live for ever.

05:032:041 If I whet my glittering sword, and mine hand take hold on
           judgment; I will render vengeance to mine enemies, and will
           reward them that hate me.

05:032:042 I will make mine arrows drunk with blood, and my sword shall
           devour flesh; and that with the blood of the slain and of the
           captives, from the beginning of revenges upon the enemy.

05:032:043 Rejoice, O ye nations, with his people: for he will avenge the
           blood of his servants, and will render vengeance to his
           adversaries, and will be merciful unto his land, and to his
           people.

05:032:044 And Moses came and spake all the words of this song in the
           ears of the people, he, and Hoshea the son of Nun.

05:032:045 And Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all
           Israel:

05:032:046 And he said unto them, Set your hearts unto all the words
           which I testify among you this day, which ye shall command
           your children to observe to do, all the words of this law.

05:032:047 For it is not a vain thing for you; because it is your life:
           and through this thing ye shall prolong your days in the land,
           whither ye go over Jordan to possess it.

05:032:048 And the LORD spake unto Moses that selfsame day, saying,

05:032:049 Get thee up into this mountain Abarim, unto mount Nebo, which
           is in the land of Moab, that is over against Jericho; and
           behold the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of
           Israel for a possession:

05:032:050 And die in the mount whither thou goest up, and be gathered
           unto thy people; as Aaron thy brother died in mount Hor, and
           was gathered unto his people:

05:032:051 Because ye trespassed against me among the children of Israel
           at the waters of MeribahKadesh, in the wilderness of Zin;
           because ye sanctified me not in the midst of the children of
           Israel.

05:032:052 Yet thou shalt see the land before thee; but thou shalt not go
           thither unto the land which I give the children of Israel.

05:033:001 And this is the blessing, wherewith Moses the man of God
           blessed the children of Israel before his death.

05:033:002 And he said, The LORD came from Sinai, and rose up from Seir
           unto them; he shined forth from mount Paran, and he came with
           ten thousands of saints: from his right hand went a fiery law
           for them.

05:033:003 Yea, he loved the people; all his saints are in thy hand: and
           they sat down at thy feet; every one shall receive of thy
           words.

05:033:004 Moses commanded us a law, even the inheritance of the
           congregation of Jacob.

05:033:005 And he was king in Jeshurun, when the heads of the people and
           the tribes of Israel were gathered together.

05:033:006 Let Reuben live, and not die; and let not his men be few.

05:033:007 And this is the blessing of Judah: and he said, Hear, LORD,
           the voice of Judah, and bring him unto his people: let his
           hands be sufficient for him; and be thou an help to him from
           his enemies.

05:033:008 And of Levi he said, Let thy Thummim and thy Urim be with thy
           holy one, whom thou didst prove at Massah, and with whom thou
           didst strive at the waters of Meribah;

05:033:009 Who said unto his father and to his mother, I have not seen
           him; neither did he acknowledge his brethren, nor knew his own
           children: for they have observed thy word, and kept thy
           covenant.

05:033:010 They shall teach Jacob thy judgments, and Israel thy law: they
           shall put incense before thee, and whole burnt sacrifice upon
           thine altar.

05:033:011 Bless, LORD, his substance, and accept the work of his hands;
           smite through the loins of them that rise against him, and of
           them that hate him, that they rise not again.

05:033:012 And of Benjamin he said, The beloved of the LORD shall dwell
           in safety by him; and the Lord shall cover him all the day
           long, and he shall dwell between his shoulders.

05:033:013 And of Joseph he said, Blessed of the LORD be his land, for
           the precious things of heaven, for the dew, and for the deep
           that coucheth beneath,

05:033:014 And for the precious fruits brought forth by the sun, and for
           the precious things put forth by the moon,

05:033:015 And for the chief things of the ancient mountains, and for the
           precious things of the lasting hills,

05:033:016 And for the precious things of the earth and fulness thereof,
           and for the good will of him that dwelt in the bush: let the
           blessing come upon the head of Joseph, and upon the top of the
           head of him that was separated from his brethren.

05:033:017 His glory is like the firstling of his bullock, and his horns
           are like the horns of unicorns: with them he shall push the
           people together to the ends of the earth: and they are the ten
           thousands of Ephraim, and they are the thousands of Manasseh.

05:033:018 And of Zebulun he said, Rejoice, Zebulun, in thy going out;
           and, Issachar, in thy tents.

05:033:019 They shall call the people unto the mountain; there they shall
           offer sacrifices of righteousness: for they shall suck of the
           abundance of the seas, and of treasures hid in the sand.

05:033:020 And of Gad he said, Blessed be he that enlargeth Gad: he
           dwelleth as a lion, and teareth the arm with the crown of the
           head.

05:033:021 And he provided the first part for himself, because there, in
           a portion of the lawgiver, was he seated; and he came with the
           heads of the people, he executed the justice of the LORD, and
           his judgments with Israel.

05:033:022 And of Dan he said, Dan is a lion's whelp: he shall leap from
           Bashan.

05:033:023 And of Naphtali he said, O Naphtali, satisfied with favour,
           and full with the blessing of the LORD: possess thou the west
           and the south.

05:033:024 And of Asher he said, Let Asher be blessed with children; let
           him be acceptable to his brethren, and let him dip his foot in
           oil.

05:033:025 Thy shoes shall be iron and brass; and as thy days, so shall
           thy strength be.

05:033:026 There is none like unto the God of Jeshurun, who rideth upon
           the heaven in thy help, and in his excellency on the sky.

05:033:027 The eternal God is thy refuge, and underneath are the
           everlasting arms: and he shall thrust out the enemy from
           before thee; and shall say, Destroy them.

05:033:028 Israel then shall dwell in safety alone: the fountain of Jacob
           shall be upon a land of corn and wine; also his heavens shall
           drop down dew.

05:033:029 Happy art thou, O Israel: who is like unto thee, O people
           saved by the LORD, the shield of thy help, and who is the
           sword of thy excellency! and thine enemies shall be found
           liars unto thee; and thou shalt tread upon their high places.

05:034:001 And Moses went up from the plains of Moab unto the mountain of
           Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, that is over against Jericho. And
           the LORD shewed him all the land of Gilead, unto Dan,

05:034:002 And all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim, and Manasseh, and
           all the land of Judah, unto the utmost sea,

05:034:003 And the south, and the plain of the valley of Jericho, the
           city of palm trees, unto Zoar.

05:034:004 And the LORD said unto him, This is the land which I sware
           unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, saying, I will give
           it unto thy seed: I have caused thee to see it with thine
           eyes, but thou shalt not go over thither.

05:034:005 So Moses the servant of the LORD died there in the land of
           Moab, according to the word of the LORD.

05:034:006 And he buried him in a valley in the land of Moab, over
           against Bethpeor: but no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto
           this day.

05:034:007 And Moses was an hundred and twenty years old when he died:
           his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated.

05:034:008 And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of
           Moab thirty days: so the days of weeping and mourning for
           Moses were ended.

05:034:009 And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom;
           for Moses had laid his hands upon him: and the children of
           Israel hearkened unto him, and did as the LORD commanded
           Moses.

05:034:010 And there arose not a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses,
           whom the LORD knew face to face,

05:034:011 In all the signs and the wonders, which the LORD sent him to
           do in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh, and to all his servants,
           and to all his land,

05:034:012 And in all that mighty hand, and in all the great terror which
           Moses shewed in the sight of all Israel.

Book 06        Joshua

06:001:001 Now after the death of Moses the servant of the LORD it came
           to pass, that the LORD spake unto Joshua the son of Nun,
           Moses' minister, saying,

06:001:002 Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over this
           Jordan, thou, and all this people, unto the land which I do
           give to them, even to the children of Israel.

06:001:003 Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, that
           have I given unto you, as I said unto Moses.

06:001:004 From the wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the great
           river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and
           unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be
           your coast.

06:001:005 There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the
           days of thy life: as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee:
           I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.

06:001:006 Be strong and of a good courage: for unto this people shalt
           thou divide for an inheritance the land, which I sware unto
           their fathers to give them.

06:001:007 Only be thou strong and very courageous, that thou mayest
           observe to do according to all the law, which Moses my servant
           commanded thee: turn not from it to the right hand or to the
           left, that thou mayest prosper withersoever thou goest.

06:001:008 This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but
           thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest
           observe to do according to all that is written therein: for
           then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt
           have good success.

06:001:009 Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage; be
           not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the LORD thy God is
           with thee whithersoever thou goest.

06:001:010 Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,

06:001:011 Pass through the host, and command the people, saying, Prepare
           you victuals; for within three days ye shall pass over this
           Jordan, to go in to possess the land, which the LORD your God
           giveth you to possess it.

06:001:012 And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to half the
           tribe of Manasseh, spake Joshua, saying,

06:001:013 Remember the word which Moses the servant of the LORD
           commanded you, saying, The LORD your God hath given you rest,
           and hath given you this land.

06:001:014 Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle, shall remain in
           the land which Moses gave you on this side Jordan; but ye
           shall pass before your brethren armed, all the mighty men of
           valour, and help them;

06:001:015 Until the LORD have given your brethren rest, as he hath given
           you, and they also have possessed the land which the LORD your
           God giveth them: then ye shall return unto the land of your
           possession, and enjoy it, which Moses the LORD's servant gave
           you on this side Jordan toward the sunrising.

06:001:016 And they answered Joshua, saying, All that thou commandest us
           we will do, and whithersoever thou sendest us, we will go.

06:001:017 According as we hearkened unto Moses in all things, so will we
           hearken unto thee: only the LORD thy God be with thee, as he
           was with Moses.

06:001:018 Whosoever he be that doth rebel against thy commandment, and
           will not hearken unto thy words in all that thou commandest
           him, he shall be put to death: only be strong and of a good
           courage.

06:002:001 And Joshua the son of Nun sent out of Shittim two men to spy
           secretly, saying, Go view the land, even Jericho. And they
           went, and came into an harlot's house, named Rahab, and lodged
           there.

06:002:002 And it was told the king of Jericho, saying, Behold, there
           came men in hither to night of the children of Israel to
           search out the country.

06:002:003 And the king of Jericho sent unto Rahab, saying, Bring forth
           the men that are come to thee, which are entered into thine
           house: for they be come to search out all the country.

06:002:004 And the woman took the two men, and hid them, and said thus,
           There came men unto me, but I wist not whence they were:

06:002:005 And it came to pass about the time of shutting of the gate,
           when it was dark, that the men went out: whither the men went
           I wot not: pursue after them quickly; for ye shall overtake
           them.

06:002:006 But she had brought them up to the roof of the house, and hid
           them with the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order upon
           the roof.

06:002:007 And the men pursued after them the way to Jordan unto the
           fords: and as soon as they which pursued after them were gone
           out, they shut the gate.

06:002:008 And before they were laid down, she came up unto them upon the
           roof;

06:002:009 And she said unto the men, I know that the LORD hath given you
           the land, and that your terror is fallen upon us, and that all
           the inhabitants of the land faint because of you.

06:002:010 For we have heard how the LORD dried up the water of the Red
           sea for you, when ye came out of Egypt; and what ye did unto
           the two kings of the Amorites, that were on the other side
           Jordan, Sihon and Og, whom ye utterly destroyed.

06:002:011 And as soon as we had heard these things, our hearts did melt,
           neither did there remain any more courage in any man, because
           of you: for the LORD your God, he is God in heaven above, and
           in earth beneath.

06:002:012 Now therefore, I pray you, swear unto me by the LORD, since I
           have shewed you kindness, that ye will also shew kindness unto
           my father's house, and give me a true token:

06:002:013 And that ye will save alive my father, and my mother, and my
           brethren, and my sisters, and all that they have, and deliver
           our lives from death.

06:002:014 And the men answered her, Our life for yours, if ye utter not
           this our business. And it shall be, when the LORD hath given
           us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly with thee.

06:002:015 Then she let them down by a cord through the window: for her
           house was upon the town wall, and she dwelt upon the wall.

06:002:016 And she said unto them, Get you to the mountain, lest the
           pursuers meet you; and hide yourselves there three days, until
           the pursuers be returned: and afterward may ye go your way.

06:002:017 And the men said unto her, We will be blameless of this thine
           oath which thou hast made us swear.

06:002:018 Behold, when we come into the land, thou shalt bind this line
           of scarlet thread in the window which thou didst let us down
           by: and thou shalt bring thy father, and thy mother, and thy
           brethren, and all thy father's household, home unto thee.

06:002:019 And it shall be, that whosoever shall go out of the doors of
           thy house into the street, his blood shall be upon his head,
           and we will be guiltless: and whosoever shall be with thee in
           the house, his blood shall be on our head, if any hand be upon
           him.

06:002:020 And if thou utter this our business, then we will be quit of
           thine oath which thou hast made us to swear.

06:002:021 And she said, According unto your words, so be it. And she
           sent them away, and they departed: and she bound the scarlet
           line in the window.

06:002:022 And they went, and came unto the mountain, and abode there
           three days, until the pursuers were returned: and the pursuers
           sought them throughout all the way, but found them not.

06:002:023 So the two men returned, and descended from the mountain, and
           passed over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun, and told him
           all things that befell them:

06:002:024 And they said unto Joshua, Truly the LORD hath delivered into
           our hands all the land; for even all the inhabitants of the
           country do faint because of us.

06:003:001 And Joshua rose early in the morning; and they removed from
           Shittim, and came to Jordan, he and all the children of
           Israel, and lodged there before they passed over.

06:003:002 And it came to pass after three days, that the officers went
           through the host;

06:003:003 And they commanded the people, saying, When ye see the ark of
           the covenant of the LORD your God, and the priests the Levites
           bearing it, then ye shall remove from your place, and go after
           it.

06:003:004 Yet there shall be a space between you and it, about two
           thousand cubits by measure: come not near unto it, that ye may
           know the way by which ye must go: for ye have not passed this
           way heretofore.

06:003:005 And Joshua said unto the people, Sanctify yourselves: for to
           morrow the LORD will do wonders among you.

06:003:006 And Joshua spake unto the priests, saying, Take up the ark of
           the covenant, and pass over before the people. And they took
           up the ark of the covenant, and went before the people.

06:003:007 And the LORD said unto Joshua, This day will I begin to
           magnify thee in the sight of all Israel, that they may know
           that, as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee.

06:003:008 And thou shalt command the priests that bear the ark of the
           covenant, saying, When ye are come to the brink of the water
           of Jordan, ye shall stand still in Jordan.

06:003:009 And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, Come hither, and
           hear the words of the LORD your God.

06:003:010 And Joshua said, Hereby ye shall know that the living God is
           among you, and that he will without fail drive out from before
           you the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Hivites, and the
           Perizzites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the
           Jebusites.

06:003:011 Behold, the ark of the covenant of the LORD of all the earth
           passeth over before you into Jordan.

06:003:012 Now therefore take you twelve men out of the tribes of Israel,
           out of every tribe a man.

06:003:013 And it shall come to pass, as soon as the soles of the feet of
           the priests that bear the ark of the LORD, the LORD of all the
           earth, shall rest in the waters of Jordan, that the waters of
           Jordan shall be cut off from the waters that come down from
           above; and they shall stand upon an heap.

06:003:014 And it came to pass, when the people removed from their tents,
           to pass over Jordan, and the priests bearing the ark of the
           covenant before the people;

06:003:015 And as they that bare the ark were come unto Jordan, and the
           feet of the priests that bare the ark were dipped in the brim
           of the water, (for Jordan overfloweth all his banks all the
           time of harvest,)

06:003:016 That the waters which came down from above stood and rose up
           upon an heap very far from the city Adam, that is beside
           Zaretan: and those that came down toward the sea of the plain,
           even the salt sea, failed, and were cut off: and the people
           passed over right against Jericho.

06:003:017 And the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD
           stood firm on dry ground in the midst of Jordan, and all the
           Israelites passed over on dry ground, until all the people
           were passed clean over Jordan.

06:004:001 And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed
           over Jordan, that the LORD spake unto Joshua, saying,

06:004:002 Take you twelve men out of the people, out of every tribe a
           man,

06:004:003 And command ye them, saying, Take you hence out of the midst
           of Jordan, out of the place where the priests' feet stood
           firm, twelve stones, and ye shall carry them over with you,
           and leave them in the lodging place, where ye shall lodge this
           night.

06:004:004 Then Joshua called the twelve men, whom he had prepared of the
           children of Israel, out of every tribe a man:

06:004:005 And Joshua said unto them, Pass over before the ark of the
           LORD your God into the midst of Jordan, and take you up every
           man of you a stone upon his shoulder, according unto the
           number of the tribes of the children of Israel:

06:004:006 That this may be a sign among you, that when your children ask
           their fathers in time to come, saying, What mean ye by these
           stones?

06:004:007 Then ye shall answer them, That the waters of Jordan were cut
           off before the ark of the covenant of the LORD; when it passed
           over Jordan, the waters of Jordan were cut off: and these
           stones shall be for a memorial unto the children of Israel for
           ever.

06:004:008 And the children of Israel did so as Joshua commanded, and
           took up twelve stones out of the midst of Jordan, as the LORD
           spake unto Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of
           the children of Israel, and carried them over with them unto
           the place where they lodged, and laid them down there.

06:004:009 And Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of Jordan, in the
           place where the feet of the priests which bare the ark of the
           covenant stood: and they are there unto this day.

06:004:010 For the priests which bare the ark stood in the midst of
           Jordan, until everything was finished that the LORD commanded
           Joshua to speak unto the people, according to all that Moses
           commanded Joshua: and the people hasted and passed over.

06:004:011 And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed
           over, that the ark of the LORD passed over, and the priests,
           in the presence of the people.

06:004:012 And the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and half
           the tribe of Manasseh, passed over armed before the children
           of Israel, as Moses spake unto them:

06:004:013 About forty thousand prepared for war passed over before the
           LORD unto battle, to the plains of Jericho.

06:004:014 On that day the LORD magnified Joshua in the sight of all
           Israel; and they feared him, as they feared Moses, all the
           days of his life.

06:004:015 And the LORD spake unto Joshua, saying,

06:004:016 Command the priests that bear the ark of the testimony, that
           they come up out of Jordan.

06:004:017 Joshua therefore commanded the priests, saying, Come ye up out
           of Jordan.

06:004:018 And it came to pass, when the priests that bare the ark of the
           covenant of the LORD were come up out of the midst of Jordan,
           and the soles of the priests' feet were lifted up unto the dry
           land, that the waters of Jordan returned unto their place, and
           flowed over all his banks, as they did before.

06:004:019 And the people came up out of Jordan on the tenth day of the
           first month, and encamped in Gilgal, in the east border of
           Jericho.

06:004:020 And those twelve stones, which they took out of Jordan, did
           Joshua pitch in Gilgal.

06:004:021 And he spake unto the children of Israel, saying, When your
           children shall ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What
           mean these stones?

06:004:022 Then ye shall let your children know, saying, Israel came over
           this Jordan on dry land.

06:004:023 For the LORD your God dried up the waters of Jordan from
           before you, until ye were passed over, as the LORD your God
           did to the Red sea, which he dried up from before us, until we
           were gone over:

06:004:024 That all the people of the earth might know the hand of the
           LORD, that it is mighty: that ye might fear the LORD your God
           for ever.

06:005:001 And it came to pass, when all the kings of the Amorites, which
           were on the side of Jordan westward, and all the kings of the
           Canaanites, which were by the sea, heard that the LORD had
           dried up the waters of Jordan from before the children of
           Israel, until we were passed over, that their heart melted,
           neither was there spirit in them any more, because of the
           children of Israel.

06:005:002 At that time the LORD said unto Joshua, Make thee sharp
           knives, and circumcise again the children of Israel the second
           time.

06:005:003 And Joshua made him sharp knives, and circumcised the children
           of Israel at the hill of the foreskins.

06:005:004 And this is the cause why Joshua did circumcise: All the
           people that came out of Egypt, that were males, even all the
           men of war, died in the wilderness by the way, after they came
           out of Egypt.

06:005:005 Now all the people that came out were circumcised: but all the
           people that were born in the wilderness by the way as they
           came forth out of Egypt, them they had not circumcised.

06:005:006 For the children of Israel walked forty years in the
           wilderness, till all the people that were men of war, which
           came out of Egypt, were consumed, because they obeyed not the
           voice of the LORD: unto whom the LORD sware that he would not
           shew them the land, which the LORD sware unto their fathers
           that he would give us, a land that floweth with milk and
           honey.

06:005:007 And their children, whom he raised up in their stead, them
           Joshua circumcised: for they were uncircumcised, because they
           had not circumcised them by the way.

06:005:008 And it came to pass, when they had done circumcising all the
           people, that they abode in their places in the camp, till they
           were whole.

06:005:009 And the LORD said unto Joshua, This day have I rolled away the
           reproach of Egypt from off you. Wherefore the name of the
           place is called Gilgal unto this day.

06:005:010 And the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal, and kept the
           passover on the fourteenth day of the month at even in the
           plains of Jericho.

06:005:011 And they did eat of the old corn of the land on the morrow
           after the passover, unleavened cakes, and parched corn in the
           selfsame day.

06:005:012 And the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the
           old corn of the land; neither had the children of Israel manna
           any more; but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan
           that year.

06:005:013 And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he
           lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man
           over against him with his sword drawn in his hand: and Joshua
           went unto him, and said unto him, Art thou for us, or for our
           adversaries?

06:005:014 And he said, Nay; but as captain of the host of the LORD am I
           now come. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and did
           worship, and said unto him, What saith my Lord unto his
           servant?

06:005:015 And the captain of the LORD's host said unto Joshua, Loose thy
           shoe from off thy foot; for the place whereon thou standest is
           holy. And Joshua did so.

06:006:001 Now Jericho was straitly shut up because of the children of
           Israel: none went out, and none came in.

06:006:002 And the LORD said unto Joshua, See, I have given into thine
           hand Jericho, and the king thereof, and the mighty men of
           valour.

06:006:003 And ye shall compass the city, all ye men of war, and go round
           about the city once. Thus shalt thou do six days.

06:006:004 And seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of
           rams' horns: and the seventh day ye shall compass the city
           seven times, and the priests shall blow with the trumpets.

06:006:005 And it shall come to pass, that when they make a long blast
           with the ram's horn, and when ye hear the sound of the
           trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout; and
           the wall of the city shall fall down flat, and the people
           shall ascend up every man straight before him.

06:006:006 And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said unto
           them, Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests
           bear seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the LORD.

06:006:007 And he said unto the people, Pass on, and compass the city,
           and let him that is armed pass on before the ark of the LORD.

06:006:008 And it came to pass, when Joshua had spoken unto the people,
           that the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams'
           horns passed on before the LORD, and blew with the trumpets:
           and the ark of the covenant of the LORD followed them.

06:006:009 And the armed men went before the priests that blew with the
           trumpets, and the rereward came after the ark, the priests
           going on, and blowing with the trumpets.

06:006:010 And Joshua had commanded the people, saying, Ye shall not
           shout, nor make any noise with your voice, neither shall any
           word proceed out of your mouth, until the day I bid you shout;
           then shall ye shout.

06:006:011 So the ark of the LORD compassed the city, going about it
           once: and they came into the camp, and lodged in the camp.

06:006:012 And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up
           the ark of the LORD.

06:006:013 And seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams' horns before
           the ark of the LORD went on continually, and blew with the
           trumpets: and the armed men went before them; but the rereward
           came after the ark of the LORD, the priests going on, and
           blowing with the trumpets.

06:006:014 And the second day they compassed the city once, and returned
           into the camp: so they did six days.

06:006:015 And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they rose early
           about the dawning of the day, and compassed the city after the
           same manner seven times: only on that day they compassed the
           city seven times.

06:006:016 And it came to pass at the seventh time, when the priests blew
           with the trumpets, Joshua said unto the people, Shout; for the
           LORD hath given you the city.

06:006:017 And the city shall be accursed, even it, and all that are
           therein, to the LORD: only Rahab the harlot shall live, she
           and all that are with her in the house, because she hid the
           messengers that we sent.

06:006:018 And ye, in any wise keep yourselves from the accursed thing,
           lest ye make yourselves accursed, when ye take of the accursed
           thing, and make the camp of Israel a curse, and trouble it.

06:006:019 But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron,
           are consecrated unto the LORD: they shall come into the
           treasury of the LORD.

06:006:020 So the people shouted when the priests blew with the trumpets:
           and it came to pass, when the people heard the sound of the
           trumpet, and the people shouted with a great shout, that the
           wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city,
           every man straight before him, and they took the city.

06:006:021 And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man
           and woman, young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass, with the
           edge of the sword.

06:006:022 But Joshua had said unto the two men that had spied out the
           country, Go into the harlot's house, and bring out thence the
           woman, and all that she hath, as ye sware unto her.

06:006:023 And the young men that were spies went in, and brought out
           Rahab, and her father, and her mother, and her brethren, and
           all that she had; and they brought out all her kindred, and
           left them without the camp of Israel.

06:006:024 And they burnt the city with fire, and all that was therein:
           only the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of brass and of
           iron, they put into the treasury of the house of the LORD.

06:006:025 And Joshua saved Rahab the harlot alive, and her father's
           household, and all that she had; and she dwelleth in Israel
           even unto this day; because she hid the messengers, which
           Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.

06:006:026 And Joshua adjured them at that time, saying, Cursed be the
           man before the LORD, that riseth up and buildeth this city
           Jericho: he shall lay the foundation thereof in his firstborn,
           and in his youngest son shall he set up the gates of it.

06:006:027 So the LORD was with Joshua; and his fame was noised
           throughout all the country.

06:007:001 But the children of Israel committed a trespass in the
           accursed thing: for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi,
           the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of the accursed
           thing: and the anger of the LORD was kindled against the
           children of Israel.

06:007:002 And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside
           Bethaven, on the east of Bethel, and spake unto them, saying,
           Go up and view the country. And the men went up and viewed Ai.

06:007:003 And they returned to Joshua, and said unto him, Let not all
           the people go up; but let about two or three thousand men go
           up and smite Ai; and make not all the people to labour
           thither; for they are but few.

06:007:004 So there went up thither of the people about three thousand
           men: and they fled before the men of Ai.

06:007:005 And the men of Ai smote of them about thirty and six men: for
           they chased them from before the gate even unto Shebarim, and
           smote them in the going down: wherefore the hearts of the
           people melted, and became as water.

06:007:006 And Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth upon his
           face before the ark of the LORD until the eventide, he and the
           elders of Israel, and put dust upon their heads.

06:007:007 And Joshua said, Alas, O LORD God, wherefore hast thou at all
           brought this people over Jordan, to deliver us into the hand
           of the Amorites, to destroy us? would to God we had been
           content, and dwelt on the other side Jordan!

06:007:008 O LORD, what shall I say, when Israel turneth their backs
           before their enemies!

06:007:009 For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land shall
           hear of it, and shall environ us round, and cut off our name
           from the earth: and what wilt thou do unto thy great name?

06:007:010 And the LORD said unto Joshua, Get thee up; wherefore liest
           thou thus upon thy face?

06:007:011 Israel hath sinned, and they have also transgressed my
           covenant which I commanded them: for they have even taken of
           the accursed thing, and have also stolen, and dissembled also,
           and they have put it even among their own stuff.

06:007:012 Therefore the children of Israel could not stand before their
           enemies, but turned their backs before their enemies, because
           they were accursed: neither will I be with you any more,
           except ye destroy the accursed from among you.

06:007:013 Up, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves against
           to morrow: for thus saith the LORD God of Israel, There is an
           accursed thing in the midst of thee, O Israel: thou canst not
           stand before thine enemies, until ye take away the accursed
           thing from among you.

06:007:014 In the morning therefore ye shall be brought according to your
           tribes: and it shall be, that the tribe which the LORD taketh
           shall come according to the families thereof; and the family
           which the LORD shall take shall come by households; and the
           household which the LORD shall take shall come man by man.

06:007:015 And it shall be, that he that is taken with the accursed thing
           shall be burnt with fire, he and all that he hath: because he
           hath transgressed the covenant of the LORD, and because he
           hath wrought folly in Israel.

06:007:016 So Joshua rose up early in the morning, and brought Israel by
           their tribes; and the tribe of Judah was taken:

06:007:017 And he brought the family of Judah; and he took the family of
           the Zarhites: and he brought the family of the Zarhites man by
           man; and Zabdi was taken:

06:007:018 And he brought his household man by man; and Achan, the son of
           Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of
           Judah, was taken.

06:007:019 And Joshua said unto Achan, My son, give, I pray thee, glory
           to the LORD God of Israel, and make confession unto him; and
           tell me now what thou hast done; hide it not from me.

06:007:020 And Achan answered Joshua, and said, Indeed I have sinned
           against the LORD God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done:

06:007:021 When I saw among the spoils a goodly Babylonish garment, and
           two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty
           shekels weight, then I coveted them, and took them; and,
           behold, they are hid in the earth in the midst of my tent, and
           the silver under it.

06:007:022 So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran unto the tent; and,
           behold, it was hid in his tent, and the silver under it.

06:007:023 And they took them out of the midst of the tent, and brought
           them unto Joshua, and unto all the children of Israel, and
           laid them out before the LORD.

06:007:024 And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of
           Zerah, and the silver, and the garment, and the wedge of gold,
           and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his asses,
           and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had: and they
           brought them unto the valley of Achor.

06:007:025 And Joshua said, Why hast thou troubled us? the LORD shall
           trouble thee this day. And all Israel stoned him with stones,
           and burned them with fire, after they had stoned them with
           stones.

06:007:026 And they raised over him a great heap of stones unto this day.
           So the LORD turned from the fierceness of his anger. Wherefore
           the name of that place was called, The valley of Achor, unto
           this day.

06:008:001 And the LORD said unto Joshua, Fear not, neither be thou
           dismayed: take all the people of war with thee, and arise, go
           up to Ai: see, I have given into thy hand the king of Ai, and
           his people, and his city, and his land:

06:008:002 And thou shalt do to Ai and her king as thou didst unto
           Jericho and her king: only the spoil thereof, and the cattle
           thereof, shall ye take for a prey unto yourselves: lay thee an
           ambush for the city behind it.

06:008:003 So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up against
           Ai: and Joshua chose out thirty thousand mighty men of valour,
           and sent them away by night.

06:008:004 And he commanded them, saying, Behold, ye shall lie in wait
           against the city, even behind the city: go not very far from
           the city, but be ye all ready:

06:008:005 And I, and all the people that are with me, will approach unto
           the city: and it shall come to pass, when they come out
           against us, as at the first, that we will flee before them,

06:008:006 (For they will come out after us) till we have drawn them from
           the city; for they will say, They flee before us, as at the
           first: therefore we will flee before them.

06:008:007 Then ye shall rise up from the ambush, and seize upon the
           city: for the LORD your God will deliver it into your hand.

06:008:008 And it shall be, when ye have taken the city, that ye shall
           set the city on fire: according to the commandment of the LORD
           shall ye do. See, I have commanded you.

06:008:009 Joshua therefore sent them forth: and they went to lie in
           ambush, and abode between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of
           Ai: but Joshua lodged that night among the people.

06:008:010 And Joshua rose up early in the morning, and numbered the
           people, and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the
           people to Ai.

06:008:011 And all the people, even the people of war that were with him,
           went up, and drew nigh, and came before the city, and pitched
           on the north side of Ai: now there was a valley between them
           and Ai.

06:008:012 And he took about five thousand men, and set them to lie in
           ambush between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of the city.

06:008:013 And when they had set the people, even all the host that was
           on the north of the city, and their liers in wait on the west
           of the city, Joshua went that night into the midst of the
           valley.

06:008:014 And it came to pass, when the king of Ai saw it, that they
           hasted and rose up early, and the men of the city went out
           against Israel to battle, he and all his people, at a time
           appointed, before the plain; but he wist not that there were
           liers in ambush against him behind the city.

06:008:015 And Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before
           them, and fled by the way of the wilderness.

06:008:016 And all the people that were in Ai were called together to
           pursue after them: and they pursued after Joshua, and were
           drawn away from the city.

06:008:017 And there was not a man left in Ai or Bethel, that went not
           out after Israel: and they left the city open, and pursued
           after Israel.

06:008:018 And the LORD said unto Joshua, Stretch out the spear that is
           in thy hand toward Ai; for I will give it into thine hand. And
           Joshua stretched out the spear that he had in his hand toward
           the city.

06:008:019 And the ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran
           as soon as he had stretched out his hand: and they entered
           into the city, and took it, and hasted and set the city on
           fire.

06:008:020 And when the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and,
           behold, the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven, and they
           had no power to flee this way or that way: and the people that
           fled to the wilderness turned back upon the pursuers.

06:008:021 And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken
           the city, and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they
           turned again, and slew the men of Ai.

06:008:022 And the other issued out of the city against them; so they
           were in the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on
           that side: and they smote them, so that they let none of them
           remain or escape.

06:008:023 And the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua.

06:008:024 And it came to pass, when Israel had made an end of slaying
           all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness
           wherein they chased them, and when they were all fallen on the
           edge of the sword, until they were consumed, that all the
           Israelites returned unto Ai, and smote it with the edge of the
           sword.

06:008:025 And so it was, that all that fell that day, both of men and
           women, were twelve thousand, even all the men of Ai.

06:008:026 For Joshua drew not his hand back, wherewith he stretched out
           the spear, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants
           of Ai.

06:008:027 Only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took for a
           prey unto themselves, according unto the word of the LORD
           which he commanded Joshua.

06:008:028 And Joshua burnt Ai, and made it an heap for ever, even a
           desolation unto this day.

06:008:029 And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree until eventide: and as
           soon as the sun was down, Joshua commanded that they should
           take his carcase down from the tree, and cast it at the
           entering of the gate of the city, and raise thereon a great
           heap of stones, that remaineth unto this day.

06:008:030 Then Joshua built an altar unto the LORD God of Israel in
           mount Ebal,

06:008:031 As Moses the servant of the LORD commanded the children of
           Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, an
           altar of whole stones, over which no man hath lift up any
           iron: and they offered thereon burnt offerings unto the LORD,
           and sacrificed peace offerings.

06:008:032 And he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses,
           which he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel.

06:008:033 And all Israel, and their elders, and officers, and their
           judges, stood on this side the ark and on that side before the
           priests the Levites, which bare the ark of the covenant of the
           LORD, as well the stranger, as he that was born among them;
           half of them over against mount Gerizim, and half of them over
           against mount Ebal; as Moses the servant of the LORD had
           commanded before, that they should bless the people of Israel.

06:008:034 And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessings
           and cursings, according to all that is written in the book of
           the law.

06:008:035 There was not a word of all that Moses commanded, which Joshua
           read not before all the congregation of Israel, with the
           women, and the little ones, and the strangers that were
           conversant among them.

06:009:001 And it came to pass, when all the kings which were on this
           side Jordan, in the hills, and in the valleys, and in all the
           coasts of the great sea over against Lebanon, the Hittite, and
           the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the
           Jebusite, heard thereof;

06:009:002 That they gathered themselves together, to fight with Joshua
           and with Israel, with one accord.

06:009:003 And when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done
           unto Jericho and to Ai,

06:009:004 They did work wilily, and went and made as if they had been
           ambassadors, and took old sacks upon their asses, and wine
           bottles, old, and rent, and bound up;

06:009:005 And old shoes and clouted upon their feet, and old garments
           upon them; and all the bread of their provision was dry and
           mouldy.

06:009:006 And they went to Joshua unto the camp at Gilgal, and said unto
           him, and to the men of Israel, We be come from a far country:
           now therefore make ye a league with us.

06:009:007 And the men of Israel said unto the Hivites, Peradventure ye
           dwell among us; and how shall we make a league with you?

06:009:008 And they said unto Joshua, We are thy servants. And Joshua
           said unto them, Who are ye? and from whence come ye?

06:009:009 And they said unto him, From a very far country thy servants
           are come because of the name of the LORD thy God: for we have
           heard the fame of him, and all that he did in Egypt,

06:009:010 And all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites, that
           were beyond Jordan, to Sihon king of Heshbon, and to Og king
           of Bashan, which was at Ashtaroth.

06:009:011 Wherefore our elders and all the inhabitants of our country
           spake to us, saying, Take victuals with you for the journey,
           and go to meet them, and say unto them, We are your servants:
           therefore now make ye a league with us.

06:009:012 This our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses
           on the day we came forth to go unto you; but now, behold, it
           is dry, and it is mouldy:

06:009:013 And these bottles of wine, which we filled, were new; and,
           behold, they be rent: and these our garments and our shoes are
           become old by reason of the very long journey.

06:009:014 And the men took of their victuals, and asked not counsel at
           the mouth of the LORD.

06:009:015 And Joshua made peace with them, and made a league with them,
           to let them live: and the princes of the congregation sware
           unto them.

06:009:016 And it came to pass at the end of three days after they had
           made a league with them, that they heard that they were their
           neighbours, and that they dwelt among them.

06:009:017 And the children of Israel journeyed, and came unto their
           cities on the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon, and
           Chephirah, and Beeroth, and Kirjathjearim.

06:009:018 And the children of Israel smote them not, because the princes
           of the congregation had sworn unto them by the LORD God of
           Israel. And all the congregation murmured against the princes.

06:009:019 But all the princes said unto all the congregation, We have
           sworn unto them by the LORD God of Israel: now therefore we
           may not touch them.

06:009:020 This we will do to them; we will even let them live, lest
           wrath be upon us, because of the oath which we sware unto
           them.

06:009:021 And the princes said unto them, Let them live; but let them be
           hewers of wood and drawers of water unto all the congregation;
           as the princes had promised them.

06:009:022 And Joshua called for them, and he spake unto them, saying,
           Wherefore have ye beguiled us, saying, We are very far from
           you; when ye dwell among us?

06:009:023 Now therefore ye are cursed, and there shall none of you be
           freed from being bondmen, and hewers of wood and drawers of
           water for the house of my God.

06:009:024 And they answered Joshua, and said, Because it was certainly
           told thy servants, how that the LORD thy God commanded his
           servant Moses to give you all the land, and to destroy all the
           inhabitants of the land from before you, therefore we were
           sore afraid of our lives because of you, and have done this
           thing.

06:009:025 And now, behold, we are in thine hand: as it seemeth good and
           right unto thee to do unto us, do.

06:009:026 And so did he unto them, and delivered them out of the hand of
           the children of Israel, that they slew them not.

06:009:027 And Joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of
           water for the congregation, and for the altar of the LORD,
           even unto this day, in the place which he should choose.

06:010:001 Now it came to pass, when Adonizedec king of Jerusalem had
           heard how Joshua had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed it;
           as he had done to Jericho and her king, so he had done to Ai
           and her king; and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace
           with Israel, and were among them;

06:010:002 That they feared greatly, because Gibeon was a great city, as
           one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai,
           and all the men thereof were mighty.

06:010:003 Wherefore Adonizedec king of Jerusalem, sent unto Hoham king
           of Hebron, and unto Piram king of Jarmuth, and unto Japhia
           king of Lachish, and unto Debir king of Eglon, saying,

06:010:004 Come up unto me, and help me, that we may smite Gibeon: for it
           hath made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel.

06:010:005 Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of
           Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king
           of Lachish, the king of Eglon, gathered themselves together,
           and went up, they and all their hosts, and encamped before
           Gibeon, and made war against it.

06:010:006 And the men of Gibeon sent unto Joshua to the camp to Gilgal,
           saying, Slack not thy hand from thy servants; come up to us
           quickly, and save us, and help us: for all the kings of the
           Amorites that dwell in the mountains are gathered together
           against us.

06:010:007 So Joshua ascended from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war
           with him, and all the mighty men of valour.

06:010:008 And the LORD said unto Joshua, Fear them not: for I have
           delivered them into thine hand; there shall not a man of them
           stand before thee.

06:010:009 Joshua therefore came unto them suddenly, and went up from
           Gilgal all night.

06:010:010 And the LORD discomfited them before Israel, and slew them
           with a great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them along the
           way that goeth up to Bethhoron, and smote them to Azekah, and
           unto Makkedah.

06:010:011 And it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel, and were
           in the going down to Bethhoron, that the LORD cast down great
           stones from heaven upon them unto Azekah, and they died: they
           were more which died with hailstones than they whom the
           children of Israel slew with the sword.

06:010:012 Then spake Joshua to the LORD in the day when the LORD
           delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel, and
           he said in the sight of Israel, Sun, stand thou still upon
           Gibeon; and thou, Moon, in the valley of Ajalon.

06:010:013 And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the people
           had avenged themselves upon their enemies. Is not this written
           in the book of Jasher? So the sun stood still in the midst of
           heaven, and hasted not to go down about a whole day.

06:010:014 And there was no day like that before it or after it, that the
           LORD hearkened unto the voice of a man: for the LORD fought
           for Israel.

06:010:015 And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to
           Gilgal.

06:010:016 But these five kings fled, and hid themselves in a cave at
           Makkedah.

06:010:017 And it was told Joshua, saying, The five kings are found hid
           in a cave at Makkedah.

06:010:018 And Joshua said, Roll great stones upon the mouth of the cave,
           and set men by it for to keep them:

06:010:019 And stay ye not, but pursue after your enemies, and smite the
           hindmost of them; suffer them not to enter into their cities:
           for the LORD your God hath delivered them into your hand.

06:010:020 And it came to pass, when Joshua and the children of Israel
           had made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter,
           till they were consumed, that the rest which remained of them
           entered into fenced cities.

06:010:021 And all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah
           in peace: none moved his tongue against any of the children of
           Israel.

06:010:022 Then said Joshua, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring out
           those five kings unto me out of the cave.

06:010:023 And they did so, and brought forth those five kings unto him
           out of the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron,
           the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of
           Eglon.

06:010:024 And it came to pass, when they brought out those kings unto
           Joshua, that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said
           unto the captains of the men of war which went with him, Come
           near, put your feet upon the necks of these kings. And they
           came near, and put their feet upon the necks of them.

06:010:025 And Joshua said unto them, Fear not, nor be dismayed, be
           strong and of good courage: for thus shall the LORD do to all
           your enemies against whom ye fight.

06:010:026 And afterward Joshua smote them, and slew them, and hanged
           them on five trees: and they were hanging upon the trees until
           the evening.

06:010:027 And it came to pass at the time of the going down of the sun,
           that Joshua commanded, and they took them down off the trees,
           and cast them into the cave wherein they had been hid, and
           laid great stones in the cave's mouth, which remain until this
           very day.

06:010:028 And that day Joshua took Makkedah, and smote it with the edge
           of the sword, and the king thereof he utterly destroyed, them,
           and all the souls that were therein; he let none remain: and
           he did to the king of Makkedah as he did unto the king of
           Jericho.

06:010:029 Then Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him,
           unto Libnah, and fought against Libnah:

06:010:030 And the LORD delivered it also, and the king thereof, into the
           hand of Israel; and he smote it with the edge of the sword,
           and all the souls that were therein; he let none remain in it;
           but did unto the king thereof as he did unto the king of
           Jericho.

06:010:031 And Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, unto
           Lachish, and encamped against it, and fought against it:

06:010:032 And the LORD delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel, which
           took it on the second day, and smote it with the edge of the
           sword, and all the souls that were therein, according to all
           that he had done to Libnah.

06:010:033 Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua
           smote him and his people, until he had left him none
           remaining.

06:010:034 And from Lachish Joshua passed unto Eglon, and all Israel with
           him; and they encamped against it, and fought against it:

06:010:035 And they took it on that day, and smote it with the edge of
           the sword, and all the souls that were therein he utterly
           destroyed that day, according to all that he had done to
           Lachish.

06:010:036 And Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, unto
           Hebron; and they fought against it:

06:010:037 And they took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and
           the king thereof, and all the cities thereof, and all the
           souls that were therein; he left none remaining, according to
           all that he had done to Eglon; but destroyed it utterly, and
           all the souls that were therein.

06:010:038 And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir; and
           fought against it:

06:010:039 And he took it, and the king thereof, and all the cities
           thereof; and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and
           utterly destroyed all the souls that were therein; he left
           none remaining: as he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir,
           and to the king thereof; as he had done also to Libnah, and to
           her king.

06:010:040 So Joshua smote all the country of the hills, and of the
           south, and of the vale, and of the springs, and all their
           kings: he left none remaining, but utterly destroyed all that
           breathed, as the LORD God of Israel commanded.

06:010:041 And Joshua smote them from Kadeshbarnea even unto Gaza, and
           all the country of Goshen, even unto Gibeon.

06:010:042 And all these kings and their land did Joshua take at one
           time, because the LORD God of Israel fought for Israel.

06:010:043 And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to
           Gilgal.

06:011:001 And it came to pass, when Jabin king of Hazor had heard those
           things, that he sent to Jobab king of Madon, and to the king
           of Shimron, and to the king of Achshaph,

06:011:002 And to the kings that were on the north of the mountains, and
           of the plains south of Chinneroth, and in the valley, and in
           the borders of Dor on the west,

06:011:003 And to the Canaanite on the east and on the west, and to the
           Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite
           in the mountains, and to the Hivite under Hermon in the land
           of Mizpeh.

06:011:004 And they went out, they and all their hosts with them, much
           people, even as the sand that is upon the sea shore in
           multitude, with horses and chariots very many.

06:011:005 And when all these kings were met together, they came and
           pitched together at the waters of Merom, to fight against
           Israel.

06:011:006 And the LORD said unto Joshua, Be not afraid because of them:
           for to morrow about this time will I deliver them up all slain
           before Israel: thou shalt hough their horses, and burn their
           chariots with fire.

06:011:007 So Joshua came, and all the people of war with him, against
           them by the waters of Merom suddenly; and they fell upon them.

06:011:008 And the LORD delivered them into the hand of Israel, who smote
           them, and chased them unto great Zidon, and unto
           Misrephothmaim, and unto the valley of Mizpeh eastward; and
           they smote them, until they left them none remaining.

06:011:009 And Joshua did unto them as the LORD bade him: he houghed
           their horses, and burnt their chariots with fire.

06:011:010 And Joshua at that time turned back, and took Hazor, and smote
           the king thereof with the sword: for Hazor beforetime was the
           head of all those kingdoms.

06:011:011 And they smote all the souls that were therein with the edge
           of the sword, utterly destroying them: there was not any left
           to breathe: and he burnt Hazor with fire.

06:011:012 And all the cities of those kings, and all the kings of them,
           did Joshua take, and smote them with the edge of the sword,
           and he utterly destroyed them, as Moses the servant of the
           LORD commanded.

06:011:013 But as for the cities that stood still in their strength,
           Israel burned none of them, save Hazor only; that did Joshua
           burn.

06:011:014 And all the spoil of these cities, and the cattle, the
           children of Israel took for a prey unto themselves; but every
           man they smote with the edge of the sword, until they had
           destroyed them, neither left they any to breathe.

06:011:015 As the LORD commanded Moses his servant, so did Moses command
           Joshua, and so did Joshua; he left nothing undone of all that
           the LORD commanded Moses.

06:011:016 So Joshua took all that land, the hills, and all the south
           country, and all the land of Goshen, and the valley, and the
           plain, and the mountain of Israel, and the valley of the same;

06:011:017 Even from the mount Halak, that goeth up to Seir, even unto
           Baalgad in the valley of Lebanon under mount Hermon: and all
           their kings he took, and smote them, and slew them.

06:011:018 Joshua made war a long time with all those kings.

06:011:019 There was not a city that made peace with the children of
           Israel, save the Hivites the inhabitants of Gibeon: all other
           they took in battle.

06:011:020 For it was of the LORD to harden their hearts, that they
           should come against Israel in battle, that he might destroy
           them utterly, and that they might have no favour, but that he
           might destroy them, as the LORD commanded Moses.

06:011:021 And at that time came Joshua, and cut off the Anakims from the
           mountains, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all
           the mountains of Judah, and from all the mountains of Israel:
           Joshua destroyed them utterly with their cities.

06:011:022 There was none of the Anakims left in the land of the children
           of Israel: only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod, there
           remained.

06:011:023 So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that the LORD
           said unto Moses; and Joshua gave it for an inheritance unto
           Israel according to their divisions by their tribes. And the
           land rested from war.

06:012:001 Now these are the kings of the land, which the children of
           Israel smote, and possessed their land on the other side
           Jordan toward the rising of the sun, from the river Arnon unto
           mount Hermon, and all the plain on the east:

06:012:002 Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon, and ruled
           from Aroer, which is upon the bank of the river Arnon, and
           from the middle of the river, and from half Gilead, even unto
           the river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of
           Ammon;

06:012:003 And from the plain to the sea of Chinneroth on the east, and
           unto the sea of the plain, even the salt sea on the east, the
           way to Bethjeshimoth; and from the south, under Ashdothpisgah:

06:012:004 And the coast of Og king of Bashan, which was of the remnant
           of the giants, that dwelt at Ashtaroth and at Edrei,

06:012:005 And reigned in mount Hermon, and in Salcah, and in all Bashan,
           unto the border of the Geshurites and the Maachathites, and
           half Gilead, the border of Sihon king of Heshbon.

06:012:006 Them did Moses the servant of the LORD and the children of
           Israel smite: and Moses the servant of the LORD gave it for a
           possession unto the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half
           tribe of Manasseh.

06:012:007 And these are the kings of the country which Joshua and the
           children of Israel smote on this side Jordan on the west, from
           Baalgad in the valley of Lebanon even unto the mount Halak,
           that goeth up to Seir; which Joshua gave unto the tribes of
           Israel for a possession according to their divisions;

06:012:008 In the mountains, and in the valleys, and in the plains, and
           in the springs, and in the wilderness, and in the south
           country; the Hittites, the Amorites, and the Canaanites, the
           Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites:

06:012:009 The king of Jericho, one; the king of Ai, which is beside
           Bethel, one;

06:012:010 The king of Jerusalem, one; the king of Hebron, one;

06:012:011 The king of Jarmuth, one; the king of Lachish, one;

06:012:012 The king of Eglon, one; the king of Gezer, one;

06:012:013 The king of Debir, one; the king of Geder, one;

06:012:014 The king of Hormah, one; the king of Arad, one;

06:012:015 The king of Libnah, one; the king of Adullam, one;

06:012:016 The king of Makkedah, one; the king of Bethel, one;

06:012:017 The king of Tappuah, one; the king of Hepher, one;

06:012:018 The king of Aphek, one; the king of Lasharon, one;

06:012:019 The king of Madon, one; the king of Hazor, one;

06:012:020 The king of Shimronmeron, one; the king of Achshaph, one;

06:012:021 The king of Taanach, one; the king of Megiddo, one;

06:012:022 The king of Kedesh, one; the king of Jokneam of Carmel, one;

06:012:023 The king of Dor in the coast of Dor, one; the king of the
           nations of Gilgal, one;

06:012:024 The king of Tirzah, one: all the kings thirty and one.

06:013:001 Now Joshua was old and stricken in years; and the LORD said
           unto him, Thou art old and stricken in years, and there
           remaineth yet very much land to be possessed.

06:013:002 This is the land that yet remaineth: all the borders of the
           Philistines, and all Geshuri,

06:013:003 From Sihor, which is before Egypt, even unto the borders of
           Ekron northward, which is counted to the Canaanite: five lords
           of the Philistines; the Gazathites, and the Ashdothites, the
           Eshkalonites, the Gittites, and the Ekronites; also the
           Avites:

06:013:004 From the south, all the land of the Canaanites, and Mearah
           that is beside the Sidonians unto Aphek, to the borders of the
           Amorites:

06:013:005 And the land of the Giblites, and all Lebanon, toward the
           sunrising, from Baalgad under mount Hermon unto the entering
           into Hamath.

06:013:006 All the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon unto
           Misrephothmaim, and all the Sidonians, them will I drive out
           from before the children of Israel: only divide thou it by lot
           unto the Israelites for an inheritance, as I have commanded
           thee.

06:013:007 Now therefore divide this land for an inheritance unto the
           nine tribes, and the half tribe of Manasseh,

06:013:008 With whom the Reubenites and the Gadites have received their
           inheritance, which Moses gave them, beyond Jordan eastward,
           even as Moses the servant of the LORD gave them;

06:013:009 From Aroer, that is upon the bank of the river Arnon, and the
           city that is in the midst of the river, and all the plain of
           Medeba unto Dibon;

06:013:010 And all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites, which
           reigned in Heshbon, unto the border of the children of Ammon;

06:013:011 And Gilead, and the border of the Geshurites and Maachathites,
           and all mount Hermon, and all Bashan unto Salcah;

06:013:012 All the kingdom of Og in Bashan, which reigned in Ashtaroth
           and in Edrei, who remained of the remnant of the giants: for
           these did Moses smite, and cast them out.

06:013:013 Nevertheless the children of Israel expelled not the
           Geshurites, nor the Maachathites: but the Geshurites and the
           Maachathites dwell among the Israelites until this day.

06:013:014 Only unto the tribes of Levi he gave none inheritance; the
           sacrifices of the LORD God of Israel made by fire are their
           inheritance, as he said unto them.

06:013:015 And Moses gave unto the tribe of the children of Reuben
           inheritance according to their families.

06:013:016 And their coast was from Aroer, that is on the bank of the
           river Arnon, and the city that is in the midst of the river,
           and all the plain by Medeba;

06:013:017 Heshbon, and all her cities that are in the plain; Dibon, and
           Bamothbaal, and Bethbaalmeon,

06:013:018 And Jahaza, and Kedemoth, and Mephaath,

06:013:019 And Kirjathaim, and Sibmah, and Zarethshahar in the mount of
           the valley,

06:013:020 And Bethpeor, and Ashdothpisgah, and Bethjeshimoth,

06:013:021 And all the cities of the plain, and all the kingdom of Sihon
           king of the Amorites, which reigned in Heshbon, whom Moses
           smote with the princes of Midian, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and
           Hur, and Reba, which were dukes of Sihon, dwelling in the
           country.

06:013:022 Balaam also the son of Beor, the soothsayer, did the children
           of Israel slay with the sword among them that were slain by
           them.

06:013:023 And the border of the children of Reuben was Jordan, and the
           border thereof. This was the inheritance of the children of
           Reuben after their families, the cities and the villages
           thereof.

06:013:024 And Moses gave inheritance unto the tribe of Gad, even unto
           the children of Gad according to their families.

06:013:025 And their coast was Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead, and
           half the land of the children of Ammon, unto Aroer that is
           before Rabbah;

06:013:026 And from Heshbon unto Ramathmizpeh, and Betonim; and from
           Mahanaim unto the border of Debir;

06:013:027 And in the valley, Betharam, and Bethnimrah, and Succoth, and
           Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon,
           Jordan and his border, even unto the edge of the sea of
           Chinnereth on the other side Jordan eastward.

06:013:028 This is the inheritance of the children of Gad after their
           families, the cities, and their villages.

06:013:029 And Moses gave inheritance unto the half tribe of Manasseh:
           and this was the possession of the half tribe of the children
           of Manasseh by their families.

06:013:030 And their coast was from Mahanaim, all Bashan, all the kingdom
           of Og king of Bashan, and all the towns of Jair, which are in
           Bashan, threescore cities:

06:013:031 And half Gilead, and Ashtaroth, and Edrei, cities of the
           kingdom of Og in Bashan, were pertaining unto the children of
           Machir the son of Manasseh, even to the one half of the
           children of Machir by their families.

06:013:032 These are the countries which Moses did distribute for
           inheritance in the plains of Moab, on the other side Jordan,
           by Jericho, eastward.

06:013:033 But unto the tribe of Levi Moses gave not any inheritance: the
           LORD God of Israel was their inheritance, as he said unto
           them.

06:014:001 And these are the countries which the children of Israel
           inherited in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest, and
           Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the
           tribes of the children of Israel, distributed for inheritance
           to them.

06:014:002 By lot was their inheritance, as the LORD commanded by the
           hand of Moses, for the nine tribes, and for the half tribe.

06:014:003 For Moses had given the inheritance of two tribes and an half
           tribe on the other side Jordan: but unto the Levites he gave
           none inheritance among them.

06:014:004 For the children of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and
           Ephraim: therefore they gave no part unto the Levites in the
           land, save cities to dwell in, with their suburbs for their
           cattle and for their substance.

06:014:005 As the LORD commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did,
           and they divided the land.

06:014:006 Then the children of Judah came unto Joshua in Gilgal: and
           Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite said unto him, Thou
           knowest the thing that the LORD said unto Moses the man of God
           concerning me and thee in Kadeshbarnea.

06:014:007 Forty years old was I when Moses the servant of the LORD sent
           me from Kadeshbarnea to espy out the land; and I brought him
           word again as it was in mine heart.

06:014:008 Nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart
           of the people melt: but I wholly followed the LORD my God.

06:014:009 And Moses sware on that day, saying, Surely the land whereon
           thy feet have trodden shall be thine inheritance, and thy
           children's for ever, because thou hast wholly followed the
           LORD my God.

06:014:010 And now, behold, the LORD hath kept me alive, as he said,
           these forty and five years, even since the LORD spake this
           word unto Moses, while the children of Israel wandered in the
           wilderness: and now, lo, I am this day fourscore and five
           years old.

06:014:011 As yet I am as strong this day as I was in the day that Moses
           sent me: as my strength was then, even so is my strength now,
           for war, both to go out, and to come in.

06:014:012 Now therefore give me this mountain, whereof the LORD spake in
           that day; for thou heardest in that day how the Anakims were
           there, and that the cities were great and fenced: if so be the
           LORD will be with me, then I shall be able to drive them out,
           as the LORD said.

06:014:013 And Joshua blessed him, and gave unto Caleb the son of
           Jephunneh Hebron for an inheritance.

06:014:014 Hebron therefore became the inheritance of Caleb the son of
           Jephunneh the Kenezite unto this day, because that he wholly
           followed the LORD God of Israel.

06:014:015 And the name of Hebron before was Kirjatharba; which Arba was
           a great man among the Anakims. And the land had rest from war.

06:015:001 This then was the lot of the tribe of the children of Judah by
           their families; even to the border of Edom the wilderness of
           Zin southward was the uttermost part of the south coast.

06:015:002 And their south border was from the shore of the salt sea,
           from the bay that looketh southward:

06:015:003 And it went out to the south side to Maalehacrabbim, and
           passed along to Zin, and ascended up on the south side unto
           Kadeshbarnea, and passed along to Hezron, and went up to Adar,
           and fetched a compass to Karkaa:

06:015:004 From thence it passed toward Azmon, and went out unto the
           river of Egypt; and the goings out of that coast were at the
           sea: this shall be your south coast.

06:015:005 And the east border was the salt sea, even unto the end of
           Jordan. And their border in the north quarter was from the bay
           of the sea at the uttermost part of Jordan:

06:015:006 And the border went up to Bethhogla, and passed along by the
           north of Betharabah; and the border went up to the stone of
           Bohan the son of Reuben:

06:015:007 And the border went up toward Debir from the valley of Achor,
           and so northward, looking toward Gilgal, that is before the
           going up to Adummim, which is on the south side of the river:
           and the border passed toward the waters of Enshemesh, and the
           goings out thereof were at Enrogel:

06:015:008 And the border went up by the valley of the son of Hinnom unto
           the south side of the Jebusite; the same is Jerusalem: and the
           border went up to the top of the mountain that lieth before
           the valley of Hinnom westward, which is at the end of the
           valley of the giants northward:

06:015:009 And the border was drawn from the top of the hill unto the
           fountain of the water of Nephtoah, and went out to the cities
           of mount Ephron; and the border was drawn to Baalah, which is
           Kirjathjearim:

06:015:010 And the border compassed from Baalah westward unto mount Seir,
           and passed along unto the side of mount Jearim, which is
           Chesalon, on the north side, and went down to Bethshemesh, and
           passed on to Timnah:

06:015:011 And the border went out unto the side of Ekron northward: and
           the border was drawn to Shicron, and passed along to mount
           Baalah, and went out unto Jabneel; and the goings out of the
           border were at the sea.

06:015:012 And the west border was to the great sea, and the coast
           thereof. This is the coast of the children of Judah round
           about according to their families.

06:015:013 And unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh he gave a part among the
           children of Judah, according to the commandment of the LORD to
           Joshua, even the city of Arba the father of Anak, which city
           is Hebron.

06:015:014 And Caleb drove thence the three sons of Anak, Sheshai, and
           Ahiman, and Talmai, the children of Anak.

06:015:015 And he went up thence to the inhabitants of Debir: and the
           name of Debir before was Kirjathsepher.

06:015:016 And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjathsepher, and taketh it,
           to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife.

06:015:017 And Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, took it:
           and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.

06:015:018 And it came to pass, as she came unto him, that she moved him
           to ask of her father a field: and she lighted off her ass; and
           Caleb said unto her, What wouldest thou?

06:015:019 Who answered, Give me a blessing; for thou hast given me a
           south land; give me also springs of water. And he gave her the
           upper springs, and the nether springs.

06:015:020 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Judah
           according to their families.

06:015:021 And the uttermost cities of the tribe of the children of Judah
           toward the coast of Edom southward were Kabzeel, and Eder, and
           Jagur,

06:015:022 And Kinah, and Dimonah, and Adadah,

06:015:023 And Kedesh, and Hazor, and Ithnan,

06:015:024 Ziph, and Telem, and Bealoth,

06:015:025 And Hazor, Hadattah, and Kerioth, and Hezron, which is Hazor,

06:015:026 Amam, and Shema, and Moladah,

06:015:027 And Hazargaddah, and Heshmon, and Bethpalet,

06:015:028 And Hazarshual, and Beersheba, and Bizjothjah,

06:015:029 Baalah, and Iim, and Azem,

06:015:030 And Eltolad, and Chesil, and Hormah,

06:015:031 And Ziklag, and Madmannah, and Sansannah,

06:015:032 And Lebaoth, and Shilhim, and Ain, and Rimmon: all the cities
           are twenty and nine, with their villages:

06:015:033 And in the valley, Eshtaol, and Zoreah, and Ashnah,

06:015:034 And Zanoah, and Engannim, Tappuah, and Enam,

06:015:035 Jarmuth, and Adullam, Socoh, and Azekah,

06:015:036 And Sharaim, and Adithaim, and Gederah, and Gederothaim;
           fourteen cities with their villages:

06:015:037 Zenan, and Hadashah, and Migdalgad,

06:015:038 And Dilean, and Mizpeh, and Joktheel,

06:015:039 Lachish, and Bozkath, and Eglon,

06:015:040 And Cabbon, and Lahmam, and Kithlish,

06:015:041 And Gederoth, Bethdagon, and Naamah, and Makkedah; sixteen
           cities with their villages:

06:015:042 Libnah, and Ether, and Ashan,

06:015:043 And Jiphtah, and Ashnah, and Nezib,

06:015:044 And Keilah, and Achzib, and Mareshah; nine cities with their
           villages:

06:015:045 Ekron, with her towns and her villages:

06:015:046 From Ekron even unto the sea, all that lay near Ashdod, with
           their villages:

06:015:047 Ashdod with her towns and her villages, Gaza with her towns
           and her villages, unto the river of Egypt, and the great sea,
           and the border thereof:

06:015:048 And in the mountains, Shamir, and Jattir, and Socoh,

06:015:049 And Dannah, and Kirjathsannah, which is Debir,

06:015:050 And Anab, and Eshtemoh, and Anim,

06:015:051 And Goshen, and Holon, and Giloh; eleven cities with their
           villages:

06:015:052 Arab, and Dumah, and Eshean,

06:015:053 And Janum, and Bethtappuah, and Aphekah,

06:015:054 And Humtah, and Kirjatharba, which is Hebron, and Zior; nine
           cities with their villages:

06:015:055 Maon, Carmel, and Ziph, and Juttah,

06:015:056 And Jezreel, and Jokdeam, and Zanoah,

06:015:057 Cain, Gibeah, and Timnah; ten cities with their villages:

06:015:058 Halhul, Bethzur, and Gedor,

06:015:059 And Maarath, and Bethanoth, and Eltekon; six cities with their
           villages:

06:015:060 Kirjathbaal, which is Kirjathjearim, and Rabbah; two cities
           with their villages:

06:015:061 In the wilderness, Betharabah, Middin, and Secacah,

06:015:062 And Nibshan, and the city of Salt, and Engedi; six cities with
           their villages.

06:015:063 As for the Jebusites the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the
           children of Judah could not drive them out; but the Jebusites
           dwell with the children of Judah at Jerusalem unto this day.

06:016:001 And the lot of the children of Joseph fell from Jordan by
           Jericho, unto the water of Jericho on the east, to the
           wilderness that goeth up from Jericho throughout mount Bethel,

06:016:002 And goeth out from Bethel to Luz, and passeth along unto the
           borders of Archi to Ataroth,

06:016:003 And goeth down westward to the coast of Japhleti, unto the
           coast of Bethhoron the nether, and to Gezer; and the goings
           out thereof are at the sea.

06:016:004 So the children of Joseph, Manasseh and Ephraim, took their
           inheritance.

06:016:005 And the border of the children of Ephraim according to their
           families was thus: even the border of their inheritance on the
           east side was Atarothaddar, unto Bethhoron the upper;

06:016:006 And the border went out toward the sea to Michmethah on the
           north side; and the border went about eastward unto
           Taanathshiloh, and passed by it on the east to Janohah;

06:016:007 And it went down from Janohah to Ataroth, and to Naarath, and
           came to Jericho, and went out at Jordan.

06:016:008 The border went out from Tappuah westward unto the river
           Kanah; and the goings out thereof were at the sea. This is the
           inheritance of the tribe of the children of Ephraim by their
           families.

06:016:009 And the separate cities for the children of Ephraim were among
           the inheritance of the children of Manasseh, all the cities
           with their villages.

06:016:010 And they drave not out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer: but
           the Canaanites dwell among the Ephraimites unto this day, and
           serve under tribute.

06:017:001 There was also a lot for the tribe of Manasseh; for he was the
           firstborn of Joseph; to wit, for Machir the firstborn of
           Manasseh, the father of Gilead: because he was a man of war,
           therefore he had Gilead and Bashan.

06:017:002 There was also a lot for the rest of the children of Manasseh
           by their families; for the children of Abiezer, and for the
           children of Helek, and for the children of Asriel, and for the
           children of Shechem, and for the children of Hepher, and for
           the children of Shemida: these were the male children of
           Manasseh the son of Joseph by their families.

06:017:003 But Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son
           of Machir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons, but daughters:
           and these are the names of his daughters, Mahlah, and Noah,
           Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.

06:017:004 And they came near before Eleazar the priest, and before
           Joshua the son of Nun, and before the princes, saying, The
           LORD commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our
           brethren. Therefore according to the commandment of the LORD
           he gave them an inheritance among the brethren of their
           father.

06:017:005 And there fell ten portions to Manasseh, beside the land of
           Gilead and Bashan, which were on the other side Jordan;

06:017:006 Because the daughters of Manasseh had an inheritance among his
           sons: and the rest of Manasseh's sons had the land of Gilead.

06:017:007 And the coast of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethah, that
           lieth before Shechem; and the border went along on the right
           hand unto the inhabitants of Entappuah.

06:017:008 Now Manasseh had the land of Tappuah: but Tappuah on the
           border of Manasseh belonged to the children of Ephraim;

06:017:009 And the coast descended unto the river Kanah, southward of the
           river: these cities of Ephraim are among the cities of
           Manasseh: the coast of Manasseh also was on the north side of
           the river, and the outgoings of it were at the sea:

06:017:010 Southward it was Ephraim's, and northward it was Manasseh's,
           and the sea is his border; and they met together in Asher on
           the north, and in Issachar on the east.

06:017:011 And Manasseh had in Issachar and in Asher Bethshean and her
           towns, and Ibleam and her towns, and the inhabitants of Dor
           and her towns, and the inhabitants of Endor and her towns, and
           the inhabitants of Taanach and her towns, and the inhabitants
           of Megiddo and her towns, even three countries.

06:017:012 Yet the children of Manasseh could not drive out the
           inhabitants of those cities; but the Canaanites would dwell in
           that land.

06:017:013 Yet it came to pass, when the children of Israel were waxen
           strong, that they put the Canaanites to tribute, but did not
           utterly drive them out.

06:017:014 And the children of Joseph spake unto Joshua, saying, Why hast
           thou given me but one lot and one portion to inherit, seeing I
           am a great people, forasmuch as the LORD hath blessed me
           hitherto?

06:017:015 And Joshua answered them, If thou be a great people, then get
           thee up to the wood country, and cut down for thyself there in
           the land of the Perizzites and of the giants, if mount Ephraim
           be too narrow for thee.

06:017:016 And the children of Joseph said, The hill is not enough for
           us: and all the Canaanites that dwell in the land of the
           valley have chariots of iron, both they who are of Bethshean
           and her towns, and they who are of the valley of Jezreel.

06:017:017 And Joshua spake unto the house of Joseph, even to Ephraim and
           to Manasseh, saying, Thou art a great people, and hast great
           power: thou shalt not have one lot only:

06:017:018 But the mountain shall be thine; for it is a wood, and thou
           shalt cut it down: and the outgoings of it shall be thine: for
           thou shalt drive out the Canaanites, though they have iron
           chariots, and though they be strong.

06:018:001 And the whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled
           together at Shiloh, and set up the tabernacle of the
           congregation there. And the land was subdued before them.

06:018:002 And there remained among the children of Israel seven tribes,
           which had not yet received their inheritance.

06:018:003 And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, How long are ye
           slack to go to possess the land, which the LORD God of your
           fathers hath given you?

06:018:004 Give out from among you three men for each tribe: and I will
           send them, and they shall rise, and go through the land, and
           describe it according to the inheritance of them; and they
           shall come again to me.

06:018:005 And they shall divide it into seven parts: Judah shall abide
           in their coast on the south, and the house of Joseph shall
           abide in their coasts on the north.

06:018:006 Ye shall therefore describe the land into seven parts, and
           bring the description hither to me, that I may cast lots for
           you here before the LORD our God.

06:018:007 But the Levites have no part among you; for the priesthood of
           the LORD is their inheritance: and Gad, and Reuben, and half
           the tribe of Manasseh, have received their inheritance beyond
           Jordan on the east, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave
           them.

06:018:008 And the men arose, and went away: and Joshua charged them that
           went to describe the land, saying, Go and walk through the
           land, and describe it, and come again to me, that I may here
           cast lots for you before the LORD in Shiloh.

06:018:009 And the men went and passed through the land, and described it
           by cities into seven parts in a book, and came again to Joshua
           to the host at Shiloh.

06:018:010 And Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before the LORD: and
           there Joshua divided the land unto the children of Israel
           according to their divisions.

06:018:011 And the lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin came up
           according to their families: and the coast of their lot came
           forth between the children of Judah and the children of
           Joseph.

06:018:012 And their border on the north side was from Jordan; and the
           border went up to the side of Jericho on the north side, and
           went up through the mountains westward; and the goings out
           thereof were at the wilderness of Bethaven.

06:018:013 And the border went over from thence toward Luz, to the side
           of Luz, which is Bethel, southward; and the border descended
           to Atarothadar, near the hill that lieth on the south side of
           the nether Bethhoron.

06:018:014 And the border was drawn thence, and compassed the corner of
           the sea southward, from the hill that lieth before Bethhoron
           southward; and the goings out thereof were at Kirjathbaal,
           which is Kirjathjearim, a city of the children of Judah: this
           was the west quarter.

06:018:015 And the south quarter was from the end of Kirjathjearim, and
           the border went out on the west, and went out to the well of
           waters of Nephtoah:

06:018:016 And the border came down to the end of the mountain that lieth
           before the valley of the son of Hinnom, and which is in the
           valley of the giants on the north, and descended to the valley
           of Hinnom, to the side of Jebusi on the south, and descended
           to Enrogel,

06:018:017 And was drawn from the north, and went forth to Enshemesh, and
           went forth toward Geliloth, which is over against the going up
           of Adummim, and descended to the stone of Bohan the son of
           Reuben,

06:018:018 And passed along toward the side over against Arabah
           northward, and went down unto Arabah:

06:018:019 And the border passed along to the side of Bethhoglah
           northward: and the outgoings of the border were at the north
           bay of the salt sea at the south end of Jordan: this was the
           south coast.

06:018:020 And Jordan was the border of it on the east side. This was the
           inheritance of the children of Benjamin, by the coasts thereof
           round about, according to their families.

06:018:021 Now the cities of the tribe of the children of Benjamin
           according to their families were Jericho, and Bethhoglah, and
           the valley of Keziz,

06:018:022 And Betharabah, and Zemaraim, and Bethel,

06:018:023 And Avim, and Pharah, and Ophrah,

06:018:024 And Chepharhaammonai, and Ophni, and Gaba; twelve cities with
           their villages:

06:018:025 Gibeon, and Ramah, and Beeroth,

06:018:026 And Mizpeh, and Chephirah, and Mozah,

06:018:027 And Rekem, and Irpeel, and Taralah,

06:018:028 And Zelah, Eleph, and Jebusi, which is Jerusalem, Gibeath, and
           Kirjath; fourteen cities with their villages. This is the
           inheritance of the children of Benjamin according to their
           families.

06:019:001 And the second lot came forth to Simeon, even for the tribe of
           the children of Simeon according to their families: and their
           inheritance was within the inheritance of the children of
           Judah.

06:019:002 And they had in their inheritance Beersheba, and Sheba, and
           Moladah,

06:019:003 And Hazarshual, and Balah, and Azem,

06:019:004 And Eltolad, and Bethul, and Hormah,

06:019:005 And Ziklag, and Bethmarcaboth, and Hazarsusah,

06:019:006 And Bethlebaoth, and Sharuhen; thirteen cities and their
           villages:

06:019:007 Ain, Remmon, and Ether, and Ashan; four cities and their
           villages:

06:019:008 And all the villages that were round about these cities to
           Baalathbeer, Ramath of the south. This is the inheritance of
           the tribe of the children of Simeon according to their
           families.

06:019:009 Out of the portion of the children of Judah was the
           inheritance of the children of Simeon: for the part of the
           children of Judah was too much for them: therefore the
           children of Simeon had their inheritance within the
           inheritance of them.

06:019:010 And the third lot came up for the children of Zebulun
           according to their families: and the border of their
           inheritance was unto Sarid:

06:019:011 And their border went up toward the sea, and Maralah, and
           reached to Dabbasheth, and reached to the river that is before
           Jokneam;

06:019:012 And turned from Sarid eastward toward the sunrising unto the
           border of Chislothtabor, and then goeth out to Daberath, and
           goeth up to Japhia,

06:019:013 And from thence passeth on along on the east to Gittahhepher,
           to Ittahkazin, and goeth out to Remmonmethoar to Neah;

06:019:014 And the border compasseth it on the north side to Hannathon:
           and the outgoings thereof are in the valley of Jiphthahel:

06:019:015 And Kattath, and Nahallal, and Shimron, and Idalah, and
           Bethlehem: twelve cities with their villages.

06:019:016 This is the inheritance of the children of Zebulun according
           to their families, these cities with their villages.

06:019:017 And the fourth lot came out to Issachar, for the children of
           Issachar according to their families.

06:019:018 And their border was toward Jezreel, and Chesulloth, and
           Shunem,

06:019:019 And Haphraim, and Shihon, and Anaharath,

06:019:020 And Rabbith, and Kishion, and Abez,

06:019:021 And Remeth, and Engannim, and Enhaddah, and Bethpazzez;

06:019:022 And the coast reacheth to Tabor, and Shahazimah, and
           Bethshemesh; and the outgoings of their border were at Jordan:
           sixteen cities with their villages.

06:019:023 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of
           Issachar according to their families, the cities and their
           villages.

06:019:024 And the fifth lot came out for the tribe of the children of
           Asher according to their families.

06:019:025 And their border was Helkath, and Hali, and Beten, and
           Achshaph,

06:019:026 And Alammelech, and Amad, and Misheal; and reacheth to Carmel
           westward, and to Shihorlibnath;

06:019:027 And turneth toward the sunrising to Bethdagon, and reacheth to
           Zebulun, and to the valley of Jiphthahel toward the north side
           of Bethemek, and Neiel, and goeth out to Cabul on the left
           hand,

06:019:028 And Hebron, and Rehob, and Hammon, and Kanah, even unto great
           Zidon;

06:019:029 And then the coast turneth to Ramah, and to the strong city
           Tyre; and the coast turneth to Hosah; and the outgoings
           thereof are at the sea from the coast to Achzib:

06:019:030 Ummah also, and Aphek, and Rehob: twenty and two cities with
           their villages.

06:019:031 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Asher
           according to their families, these cities with their villages.

06:019:032 The sixth lot came out to the children of Naphtali, even for
           the children of Naphtali according to their families.

06:019:033 And their coast was from Heleph, from Allon to Zaanannim, and
           Adami, Nekeb, and Jabneel, unto Lakum; and the outgoings
           thereof were at Jordan:

06:019:034 And then the coast turneth westward to Aznothtabor, and goeth
           out from thence to Hukkok, and reacheth to Zebulun on the
           south side, and reacheth to Asher on the west side, and to
           Judah upon Jordan toward the sunrising.

06:019:035 And the fenced cities are Ziddim, Zer, and Hammath, Rakkath,
           and Chinnereth,

06:019:036 And Adamah, and Ramah, and Hazor,

06:019:037 And Kedesh, and Edrei, and Enhazor,

06:019:038 And Iron, and Migdalel, Horem, and Bethanath, and Bethshemesh;
           nineteen cities with their villages.

06:019:039 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of
           Naphtali according to their families, the cities and their
           villages.

06:019:040 And the seventh lot came out for the tribe of the children of
           Dan according to their families.

06:019:041 And the coast of their inheritance was Zorah, and Eshtaol, and
           Irshemesh,

06:019:042 And Shaalabbin, and Ajalon, and Jethlah,

06:019:043 And Elon, and Thimnathah, and Ekron,

06:019:044 And Eltekeh, and Gibbethon, and Baalath,

06:019:045 And Jehud, and Beneberak, and Gathrimmon,

06:019:046 And Mejarkon, and Rakkon, with the border before Japho.

06:019:047 And the coast of the children of Dan went out too little for
           them: therefore the children of Dan went up to fight against
           Leshem, and took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword,
           and possessed it, and dwelt therein, and called Leshem, Dan,
           after the name of Dan their father.

06:019:048 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Dan
           according to their families, these cities with their villages.

06:019:049 When they had made an end of dividing the land for inheritance
           by their coasts, the children of Israel gave an inheritance to
           Joshua the son of Nun among them:

06:019:050 According to the word of the LORD they gave him the city which
           he asked, even Timnathserah in mount Ephraim: and he built the
           city, and dwelt therein.

06:019:051 These are the inheritances, which Eleazar the priest, and
           Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the
           tribes of the children of Israel, divided for an inheritance
           by lot in Shiloh before the LORD, at the door of the
           tabernacle of the congregation. So they made an end of
           dividing the country.

06:020:001 The LORD also spake unto Joshua, saying,

06:020:002 Speak to the children of Israel, saying, Appoint out for you
           cities of refuge, whereof I spake unto you by the hand of
           Moses:

06:020:003 That the slayer that killeth any person unawares and
           unwittingly may flee thither: and they shall be your refuge
           from the avenger of blood.

06:020:004 And when he that doth flee unto one of those cities shall
           stand at the entering of the gate of the city, and shall
           declare his cause in the ears of the elders of that city, they
           shall take him into the city unto them, and give him a place,
           that he may dwell among them.

06:020:005 And if the avenger of blood pursue after him, then they shall
           not deliver the slayer up into his hand; because he smote his
           neighbour unwittingly, and hated him not beforetime.

06:020:006 And he shall dwell in that city, until he stand before the
           congregation for judgment, and until the death of the high
           priest that shall be in those days: then shall the slayer
           return, and come unto his own city, and unto his own house,
           unto the city from whence he fled.

06:020:007 And they appointed Kedesh in Galilee in mount Naphtali, and
           Shechem in mount Ephraim, and Kirjatharba, which is Hebron, in
           the mountain of Judah.

06:020:008 And on the other side Jordan by Jericho eastward, they
           assigned Bezer in the wilderness upon the plain out of the
           tribe of Reuben, and Ramoth in Gilead out of the tribe of Gad,
           and Golan in Bashan out of the tribe of Manasseh.

06:020:009 These were the cities appointed for all the children of
           Israel, and for the stranger that sojourneth among them, that
           whosoever killeth any person at unawares might flee thither,
           and not die by the hand of the avenger of blood, until he
           stood before the congregation.

06:021:001 Then came near the heads of the fathers of the Levites unto
           Eleazar the priest, and unto Joshua the son of Nun, and unto
           the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of
           Israel;

06:021:002 And they spake unto them at Shiloh in the land of Canaan,
           saying, The LORD commanded by the hand of Moses to give us
           cities to dwell in, with the suburbs thereof for our cattle.

06:021:003 And the children of Israel gave unto the Levites out of their
           inheritance, at the commandment of the LORD, these cities and
           their suburbs.

06:021:004 And the lot came out for the families of the Kohathites: and
           the children of Aaron the priest, which were of the Levites,
           had by lot out of the tribe of Judah, and out of the tribe of
           Simeon, and out of the tribe of Benjamin, thirteen cities.

06:021:005 And the rest of the children of Kohath had by lot out of the
           families of the tribe of Ephraim, and out of the tribe of Dan,
           and out of the half tribe of Manasseh, ten cities.

06:021:006 And the children of Gershon had by lot out of the families of
           the tribe of Issachar, and out of the tribe of Asher, and out
           of the tribe of Naphtali, and out of the half tribe of
           Manasseh in Bashan, thirteen cities.

06:021:007 The children of Merari by their families had out of the tribe
           of Reuben, and out of the tribe of Gad, and out of the tribe
           of Zebulun, twelve cities.

06:021:008 And the children of Israel gave by lot unto the Levites these
           cities with their suburbs, as the LORD commanded by the hand
           of Moses.

06:021:009 And they gave out of the tribe of the children of Judah, and
           out of the tribe of the children of Simeon, these cities which
           are here mentioned by name.

06:021:010 Which the children of Aaron, being of the families of the
           Kohathites, who were of the children of Levi, had: for theirs
           was the first lot.

06:021:011 And they gave them the city of Arba the father of Anak, which
           city is Hebron, in the hill country of Judah, with the suburbs
           thereof round about it.

06:021:012 But the fields of the city, and the villages thereof, gave
           they to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for his possession.

06:021:013 Thus they gave to the children of Aaron the priest Hebron with
           her suburbs, to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Libnah
           with her suburbs,

06:021:014 And Jattir with her suburbs, and Eshtemoa with her suburbs,

06:021:015 And Holon with her suburbs, and Debir with her suburbs,

06:021:016 And Ain with her suburbs, and Juttah with her suburbs, and
           Bethshemesh with her suburbs; nine cities out of those two
           tribes.

06:021:017 And out of the tribe of Benjamin, Gibeon with her suburbs,
           Geba with her suburbs,

06:021:018 Anathoth with her suburbs, and Almon with her suburbs; four
           cities.

06:021:019 All the cities of the children of Aaron, the priests, were
           thirteen cities with their suburbs.

06:021:020 And the families of the children of Kohath, the Levites which
           remained of the children of Kohath, even they had the cities
           of their lot out of the tribe of Ephraim.

06:021:021 For they gave them Shechem with her suburbs in mount Ephraim,
           to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Gezer with her
           suburbs,

06:021:022 And Kibzaim with her suburbs, and Bethhoron with her suburbs;
           four cities.

06:021:023 And out of the tribe of Dan, Eltekeh with her suburbs,
           Gibbethon with her suburbs,

06:021:024 Aijalon with her suburbs, Gathrimmon with her suburbs; four
           cities.

06:021:025 And out of the half tribe of Manasseh, Tanach with her
           suburbs, and Gathrimmon with her suburbs; two cities.

06:021:026 All the cities were ten with their suburbs for the families of
           the children of Kohath that remained.

06:021:027 And unto the children of Gershon, of the families of the
           Levites, out of the other half tribe of Manasseh they gave
           Golan in Bashan with her suburbs, to be a city of refuge for
           the slayer; and Beeshterah with her suburbs; two cities.

06:021:028 And out of the tribe of Issachar, Kishon with her suburbs,
           Dabareh with her suburbs,

06:021:029 Jarmuth with her suburbs, Engannim with her suburbs; four
           cities.

06:021:030 And out of the tribe of Asher, Mishal with her suburbs, Abdon
           with her suburbs,

06:021:031 Helkath with her suburbs, and Rehob with her suburbs; four
           cities.

06:021:032 And out of the tribe of Naphtali, Kedesh in Galilee with her
           suburbs, to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Hammothdor
           with her suburbs, and Kartan with her suburbs; three cities.

06:021:033 All the cities of the Gershonites according to their families
           were thirteen cities with their suburbs.

06:021:034 And unto the families of the children of Merari, the rest of
           the Levites, out of the tribe of Zebulun, Jokneam with her
           suburbs, and Kartah with her suburbs,

06:021:035 Dimnah with her suburbs, Nahalal with her suburbs; four
           cities.

06:021:036 And out of the tribe of Reuben, Bezer with her suburbs, and
           Jahazah with her suburbs,

06:021:037 Kedemoth with her suburbs, and Mephaath with her suburbs; four
           cities.

06:021:038 And out of the tribe of Gad, Ramoth in Gilead with her
           suburbs, to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Mahanaim
           with her suburbs,

06:021:039 Heshbon with her suburbs, Jazer with her suburbs; four cities
           in all.

06:021:040 So all the cities for the children of Merari by their
           families, which were remaining of the families of the Levites,
           were by their lot twelve cities.

06:021:041 All the cities of the Levites within the possession of the
           children of Israel were forty and eight cities with their
           suburbs.

06:021:042 These cities were every one with their suburbs round about
           them: thus were all these cities.

06:021:043 And the LORD gave unto Israel all the land which he sware to
           give unto their fathers; and they possessed it, and dwelt
           therein.

06:021:044 And the LORD gave them rest round about, according to all that
           he sware unto their fathers: and there stood not a man of all
           their enemies before them; the LORD delivered all their
           enemies into their hand.

06:021:045 There failed not ought of any good thing which the LORD had
           spoken unto the house of Israel; all came to pass.

06:022:001 Then Joshua called the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the
           half tribe of Manasseh,

06:022:002 And said unto them, Ye have kept all that Moses the servant of
           the LORD commanded you, and have obeyed my voice in all that I
           commanded you:

06:022:003 Ye have not left your brethren these many days unto this day,
           but have kept the charge of the commandment of the LORD your
           God.

06:022:004 And now the LORD your God hath given rest unto your brethren,
           as he promised them: therefore now return ye, and get you unto
           your tents, and unto the land of your possession, which Moses
           the servant of the LORD gave you on the other side Jordan.

06:022:005 But take diligent heed to do the commandment and the law,
           which Moses the servant of the LORD charged you, to love the
           LORD your God, and to walk in all his ways, and to keep his
           commandments, and to cleave unto him, and to serve him with
           all your heart and with all your soul.

06:022:006 So Joshua blessed them, and sent them away: and they went unto
           their tents.

06:022:007 Now to the one half of the tribe of Manasseh Moses had given
           possession in Bashan: but unto the other half thereof gave
           Joshua among their brethren on this side Jordan westward. And
           when Joshua sent them away also unto their tents, then he
           blessed them,

06:022:008 And he spake unto them, saying, Return with much riches unto
           your tents, and with very much cattle, with silver, and with
           gold, and with brass, and with iron, and with very much
           raiment: divide the spoil of your enemies with your brethren.

06:022:009 And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the
           half tribe of Manasseh returned, and departed from the
           children of Israel out of Shiloh, which is in the land of
           Canaan, to go unto the country of Gilead, to the land of their
           possession, whereof they were possessed, according to the word
           of the LORD by the hand of Moses.

06:022:010 And when they came unto the borders of Jordan, that are in the
           land of Canaan, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad
           and the half tribe of Manasseh built there an altar by Jordan,
           a great altar to see to.

06:022:011 And the children of Israel heard say, Behold, the children of
           Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh
           have built an altar over against the land of Canaan, in the
           borders of Jordan, at the passage of the children of Israel.

06:022:012 And when the children of Israel heard of it, the whole
           congregation of the children of Israel gathered themselves
           together at Shiloh, to go up to war against them.

06:022:013 And the children of Israel sent unto the children of Reuben,
           and to the children of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh,
           into the land of Gilead, Phinehas the son of Eleazar the
           priest,

06:022:014 And with him ten princes, of each chief house a prince
           throughout all the tribes of Israel; and each one was an head
           of the house of their fathers among the thousands of Israel.

06:022:015 And they came unto the children of Reuben, and to the children
           of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, unto the land of
           Gilead, and they spake with them, saying,

06:022:016 Thus saith the whole congregation of the LORD, What trespass
           is this that ye have committed against the God of Israel, to
           turn away this day from following the LORD, in that ye have
           builded you an altar, that ye might rebel this day against the
           LORD?

06:022:017 Is the iniquity of Peor too little for us, from which we are
           not cleansed until this day, although there was a plague in
           the congregation of the LORD,

06:022:018 But that ye must turn away this day from following the LORD?
           and it will be, seeing ye rebel to day against the LORD, that
           to morrow he will be wroth with the whole congregation of
           Israel.

06:022:019 Notwithstanding, if the land of your possession be unclean,
           then pass ye over unto the land of the possession of the LORD,
           wherein the LORD's tabernacle dwelleth, and take possession
           among us: but rebel not against the LORD, nor rebel against
           us, in building you an altar beside the altar of the LORD our
           God.

06:022:020 Did not Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the
           accursed thing, and wrath fell on all the congregation of
           Israel? and that man perished not alone in his iniquity.

06:022:021 Then the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the
           half tribe of Manasseh answered, and said unto the heads of
           the thousands of Israel,

06:022:022 The LORD God of gods, the LORD God of gods, he knoweth, and
           Israel he shall know; if it be in rebellion, or if in
           transgression against the LORD, (save us not this day,)

06:022:023 That we have built us an altar to turn from following the
           LORD, or if to offer thereon burnt offering or meat offering,
           or if to offer peace offerings thereon, let the LORD himself
           require it;

06:022:024 And if we have not rather done it for fear of this thing,
           saying, In time to come your children might speak unto our
           children, saying, What have ye to do with the LORD God of
           Israel?

06:022:025 For the LORD hath made Jordan a border between us and you, ye
           children of Reuben and children of Gad; ye have no part in the
           LORD: so shall your children make our children cease from
           fearing the LORD.

06:022:026 Therefore we said, Let us now prepare to build us an altar,
           not for burnt offering, nor for sacrifice:

06:022:027 But that it may be a witness between us, and you, and our
           generations after us, that we might do the service of the LORD
           before him with our burnt offerings, and with our sacrifices,
           and with our peace offerings; that your children may not say
           to our children in time to come, Ye have no part in the LORD.

06:022:028 Therefore said we, that it shall be, when they should so say
           to us or to our generations in time to come, that we may say
           again, Behold the pattern of the altar of the LORD, which our
           fathers made, not for burnt offerings, nor for sacrifices; but
           it is a witness between us and you.

06:022:029 God forbid that we should rebel against the LORD, and turn
           this day from following the LORD, to build an altar for burnt
           offerings, for meat offerings, or for sacrifices, beside the
           altar of the LORD our God that is before his tabernacle.

06:022:030 And when Phinehas the priest, and the princes of the
           congregation and heads of the thousands of Israel which were
           with him, heard the words that the children of Reuben and the
           children of Gad and the children of Manasseh spake, it pleased
           them.

06:022:031 And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said unto the
           children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the
           children of Manasseh, This day we perceive that the LORD is
           among us, because ye have not committed this trespass against
           the LORD: now ye have delivered the children of Israel out of
           the hand of the LORD.

06:022:032 And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, and the princes,
           returned from the children of Reuben, and from the children of
           Gad, out of the land of Gilead, unto the land of Canaan, to
           the children of Israel, and brought them word again.

06:022:033 And the thing pleased the children of Israel; and the children
           of Israel blessed God, and did not intend to go up against
           them in battle, to destroy the land wherein the children of
           Reuben and Gad dwelt.

06:022:034 And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad called the
           altar Ed: for it shall be a witness between us that the LORD
           is God.

06:023:001 And it came to pass a long time after that the LORD had given
           rest unto Israel from all their enemies round about, that
           Joshua waxed old and stricken in age.

06:023:002 And Joshua called for all Israel, and for their elders, and
           for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers,
           and said unto them, I am old and stricken in age:

06:023:003 And ye have seen all that the LORD your God hath done unto all
           these nations because of you; for the LORD your God is he that
           hath fought for you.

06:023:004 Behold, I have divided unto you by lot these nations that
           remain, to be an inheritance for your tribes, from Jordan,
           with all the nations that I have cut off, even unto the great
           sea westward.

06:023:005 And the LORD your God, he shall expel them from before you,
           and drive them from out of your sight; and ye shall possess
           their land, as the LORD your God hath promised unto you.

06:023:006 Be ye therefore very courageous to keep and to do all that is
           written in the book of the law of Moses, that ye turn not
           aside therefrom to the right hand or to the left;

06:023:007 That ye come not among these nations, these that remain among
           you; neither make mention of the name of their gods, nor cause
           to swear by them, neither serve them, nor bow yourselves unto
           them:

06:023:008 But cleave unto the LORD your God, as ye have done unto this
           day.

06:023:009 For the LORD hath driven out from before you great nations and
           strong: but as for you, no man hath been able to stand before
           you unto this day.

06:023:010 One man of you shall chase a thousand: for the LORD your God,
           he it is that fighteth for you, as he hath promised you.

06:023:011 Take good heed therefore unto yourselves, that ye love the
           LORD your God.

06:023:012 Else if ye do in any wise go back, and cleave unto the remnant
           of these nations, even these that remain among you, and shall
           make marriages with them, and go in unto them, and they to
           you:

06:023:013 Know for a certainty that the LORD your God will no more drive
           out any of these nations from before you; but they shall be
           snares and traps unto you, and scourges in your sides, and
           thorns in your eyes, until ye perish from off this good land
           which the LORD your God hath given you.

06:023:014 And, behold, this day I am going the way of all the earth: and
           ye know in all your hearts and in all your souls, that not one
           thing hath failed of all the good things which the LORD your
           God spake concerning you; all are come to pass unto you, and
           not one thing hath failed thereof.

06:023:015 Therefore it shall come to pass, that as all good things are
           come upon you, which the LORD your God promised you; so shall
           the LORD bring upon you all evil things, until he have
           destroyed you from off this good land which the LORD your God
           hath given you.

06:023:016 When ye have transgressed the covenant of the LORD your God,
           which he commanded you, and have gone and served other gods,
           and bowed yourselves to them; then shall the anger of the LORD
           be kindled against you, and ye shall perish quickly from off
           the good land which he hath given unto you.

06:024:001 And Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem, and
           called for the elders of Israel, and for their heads, and for
           their judges, and for their officers; and they presented
           themselves before God.

06:024:002 And Joshua said unto all the people, Thus saith the LORD God
           of Israel, Your fathers dwelt on the other side of the flood
           in old time, even Terah, the father of Abraham, and the father
           of Nachor: and they served other gods.

06:024:003 And I took your father Abraham from the other side of the
           flood, and led him throughout all the land of Canaan, and
           multiplied his seed, and gave him Isaac.

06:024:004 And I gave unto Isaac Jacob and Esau: and I gave unto Esau
           mount Seir, to possess it; but Jacob and his children went
           down into Egypt.

06:024:005 I sent Moses also and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt, according to
           that which I did among them: and afterward I brought you out.

06:024:006 And I brought your fathers out of Egypt: and ye came unto the
           sea; and the Egyptians pursued after your fathers with
           chariots and horsemen unto the Red sea.

06:024:007 And when they cried unto the LORD, he put darkness between you
           and the Egyptians, and brought the sea upon them, and covered
           them; and your eyes have seen what I have done in Egypt: and
           ye dwelt in the wilderness a long season.

06:024:008 And I brought you into the land of the Amorites, which dwelt
           on the other side Jordan; and they fought with you: and I gave
           them into your hand, that ye might possess their land; and I
           destroyed them from before you.

06:024:009 Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and warred
           against Israel, and sent and called Balaam the son of Beor to
           curse you:

06:024:010 But I would not hearken unto Balaam; therefore he blessed you
           still: so I delivered you out of his hand.

06:024:011 And you went over Jordan, and came unto Jericho: and the men
           of Jericho fought against you, the Amorites, and the
           Perizzites, and the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the
           Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites; and I delivered
           them into your hand.

06:024:012 And I sent the hornet before you, which drave them out from
           before you, even the two kings of the Amorites; but not with
           thy sword, nor with thy bow.

06:024:013 And I have given you a land for which ye did not labour, and
           cities which ye built not, and ye dwell in them; of the
           vineyards and oliveyards which ye planted not do ye eat.

06:024:014 Now therefore fear the LORD, and serve him in sincerity and in
           truth: and put away the gods which your fathers served on the
           other side of the flood, and in Egypt; and serve ye the LORD.

06:024:015 And if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD, choose you
           this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods which your
           fathers served that were on the other side of the flood, or
           the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but as for
           me and my house, we will serve the LORD.

06:024:016 And the people answered and said, God forbid that we should
           forsake the LORD, to serve other gods;

06:024:017 For the LORD our God, he it is that brought us up and our
           fathers out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage,
           and which did those great signs in our sight, and preserved us
           in all the way wherein we went, and among all the people
           through whom we passed:

06:024:018 And the LORD drave out from before us all the people, even the
           Amorites which dwelt in the land: therefore will we also serve
           the LORD; for he is our God.

06:024:019 And Joshua said unto the people, Ye cannot serve the LORD: for
           he is an holy God; he is a jealous God; he will not forgive
           your transgressions nor your sins.

06:024:020 If ye forsake the LORD, and serve strange gods, then he will
           turn and do you hurt, and consume you, after that he hath done
           you good.

06:024:021 And the people said unto Joshua, Nay; but we will serve the
           LORD.

06:024:022 And Joshua said unto the people, Ye are witnesses against
           yourselves that ye have chosen you the LORD, to serve him. And
           they said, We are witnesses.

06:024:023 Now therefore put away, said he, the strange gods which are
           among you, and incline your heart unto the LORD God of Israel.

06:024:024 And the people said unto Joshua, The LORD our God will we
           serve, and his voice will we obey.

06:024:025 So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and set
           them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem.

06:024:026 And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God,
           and took a great stone, and set it up there under an oak, that
           was by the sanctuary of the LORD.

06:024:027 And Joshua said unto all the people, Behold, this stone shall
           be a witness unto us; for it hath heard all the words of the
           LORD which he spake unto us: it shall be therefore a witness
           unto you, lest ye deny your God.

06:024:028 So Joshua let the people depart, every man unto his
           inheritance.

06:024:029 And it came to pass after these things, that Joshua the son of
           Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, being an hundred and ten
           years old.

06:024:030 And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in
           Timnathserah, which is in mount Ephraim, on the north side of
           the hill of Gaash.

06:024:031 And Israel served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the
           days of the elders that overlived Joshua, and which had known
           all the works of the LORD, that he had done for Israel.

06:024:032 And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought
           up out of Egypt, buried they in Shechem, in a parcel of ground
           which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem
           for an hundred pieces of silver: and it became the inheritance
           of the children of Joseph.

06:024:033 And Eleazar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him in a
           hill that pertained to Phinehas his son, which was given him
           in mount Ephraim.

Book 07        Judges

07:001:001 Now after the death of Joshua it came to pass, that the
           children of Israel asked the LORD, saying, Who shall go up for
           us against the Canaanites first, to fight against them?

07:001:002 And the LORD said, Judah shall go up: behold, I have delivered
           the land into his hand.

07:001:003 And Judah said unto Simeon his brother, Come up with me into
           my lot, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I
           likewise will go with thee into thy lot. So Simeon went with
           him.

07:001:004 And Judah went up; and the LORD delivered the Canaanites and
           the Perizzites into their hand: and they slew of them in Bezek
           ten thousand men.

07:001:005 And they found Adonibezek in Bezek: and they fought against
           him, and they slew the Canaanites and the Perizzites.

07:001:006 But Adonibezek fled; and they pursued after him, and caught
           him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes.

07:001:007 And Adonibezek said, Threescore and ten kings, having their
           thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered their meat under
           my table: as I have done, so God hath requited me. And they
           brought him to Jerusalem, and there he died.

07:001:008 Now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem, and
           had taken it, and smitten it with the edge of the sword, and
           set the city on fire.

07:001:009 And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against
           the Canaanites, that dwelt in the mountain, and in the south,
           and in the valley.

07:001:010 And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron:
           (now the name of Hebron before was Kirjatharba:) and they slew
           Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai.

07:001:011 And from thence he went against the inhabitants of Debir: and
           the name of Debir before was Kirjathsepher:

07:001:012 And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjathsepher, and taketh it,
           to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife.

07:001:013 And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, took
           it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.

07:001:014 And it came to pass, when she came to him, that she moved him
           to ask of her father a field: and she lighted from off her
           ass; and Caleb said unto her, What wilt thou?

07:001:015 And she said unto him, Give me a blessing: for thou hast given
           me a south land; give me also springs of water. And Caleb gave
           her the upper springs and the nether springs.

07:001:016 And the children of the Kenite, Moses' father in law, went up
           out of the city of palm trees with the children of Judah into
           the wilderness of Judah, which lieth in the south of Arad; and
           they went and dwelt among the people.

07:001:017 And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they slew the
           Canaanites that inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it.
           And the name of the city was called Hormah.

07:001:018 Also Judah took Gaza with the coast thereof, and Askelon with
           the coast thereof, and Ekron with the coast thereof.

07:001:019 And the LORD was with Judah; and he drave out the inhabitants
           of the mountain; but could not drive out the inhabitants of
           the valley, because they had chariots of iron.

07:001:020 And they gave Hebron unto Caleb, as Moses said: and he
           expelled thence the three sons of Anak.

07:001:021 And the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites
           that inhabited Jerusalem; but the Jebusites dwell with the
           children of Benjamin in Jerusalem unto this day.

07:001:022 And the house of Joseph, they also went up against Bethel: and
           the LORD was with them.

07:001:023 And the house of Joseph sent to descry Bethel. (Now the name
           of the city before was Luz.)

07:001:024 And the spies saw a man come forth out of the city, and they
           said unto him, Shew us, we pray thee, the entrance into the
           city, and we will shew thee mercy.

07:001:025 And when he shewed them the entrance into the city, they smote
           the city with the edge of the sword; but they let go the man
           and all his family.

07:001:026 And the man went into the land of the Hittites, and built a
           city, and called the name thereof Luz: which is the name
           thereof unto this day.

07:001:027 Neither did Manasseh drive out the inhabitants of Bethshean
           and her towns, nor Taanach and her towns, nor the inhabitants
           of Dor and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and her
           towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns: but the
           Canaanites would dwell in that land.

07:001:028 And it came to pass, when Israel was strong, that they put the
           Canaanites to tribute, and did not utterly drive them out.

07:001:029 Neither did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites that dwelt in
           Gezer; but the Canaanites dwelt in Gezer among them.

07:001:030 Neither did Zebulun drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor
           the inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites dwelt among
           them, and became tributaries.

07:001:031 Neither did Asher drive out the inhabitants of Accho, nor the
           inhabitants of Zidon, nor of Ahlab, nor of Achzib, nor of
           Helbah, nor of Aphik, nor of Rehob:

07:001:032 But the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants
           of the land: for they did not drive them out.

07:001:033 Neither did Naphtali drive out the inhabitants of Bethshemesh,
           nor the inhabitants of Bethanath; but he dwelt among the
           Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: nevertheless the
           inhabitants of Bethshemesh and of Bethanath became tributaries
           unto them.

07:001:034 And the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the mountain:
           for they would not suffer them to come down to the valley:

07:001:035 But the Amorites would dwell in mount Heres in Aijalon, and in
           Shaalbim: yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, so
           that they became tributaries.

07:001:036 And the coast of the Amorites was from the going up to
           Akrabbim, from the rock, and upward.

07:002:001 And an angel of the LORD came up from Gilgal to Bochim, and
           said, I made you to go up out of Egypt, and have brought you
           unto the land which I sware unto your fathers; and I said, I
           will never break my covenant with you.

07:002:002 And ye shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land;
           ye shall throw down their altars: but ye have not obeyed my
           voice: why have ye done this?

07:002:003 Wherefore I also said, I will not drive them out from before
           you; but they shall be as thorns in your sides, and their gods
           shall be a snare unto you.

07:002:004 And it came to pass, when the angel of the LORD spake these
           words unto all the children of Israel, that the people lifted
           up their voice, and wept.

07:002:005 And they called the name of that place Bochim: and they
           sacrificed there unto the LORD.

07:002:006 And when Joshua had let the people go, the children of Israel
           went every man unto his inheritance to possess the land.

07:002:007 And the people served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all
           the days of the elders that outlived Joshua, who had seen all
           the great works of the LORD, that he did for Israel.

07:002:008 And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died,
           being an hundred and ten years old.

07:002:009 And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in
           Timnathheres, in the mount of Ephraim, on the north side of
           the hill Gaash.

07:002:010 And also all that generation were gathered unto their fathers:
           and there arose another generation after them, which knew not
           the LORD, nor yet the works which he had done for Israel.

07:002:011 And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD,
           and served Baalim:

07:002:012 And they forsook the LORD God of their fathers, which brought
           them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods, of the
           gods of the people that were round about them, and bowed
           themselves unto them, and provoked the LORD to anger.

07:002:013 And they forsook the LORD, and served Baal and Ashtaroth.

07:002:014 And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he
           delivered them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them,
           and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about,
           so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies.

07:002:015 Whithersoever they went out, the hand of the LORD was against
           them for evil, as the LORD had said, and as the LORD had sworn
           unto them: and they were greatly distressed.

07:002:016 Nevertheless the LORD raised up judges, which delivered them
           out of the hand of those that spoiled them.

07:002:017 And yet they would not hearken unto their judges, but they
           went a whoring after other gods, and bowed themselves unto
           them: they turned quickly out of the way which their fathers
           walked in, obeying the commandments of the LORD; but they did
           not so.

07:002:018 And when the LORD raised them up judges, then the LORD was
           with the judge, and delivered them out of the hand of their
           enemies all the days of the judge: for it repented the LORD
           because of their groanings by reason of them that oppressed
           them and vexed them.

07:002:019 And it came to pass, when the judge was dead, that they
           returned, and corrupted themselves more than their fathers, in
           following other gods to serve them, and to bow down unto them;
           they ceased not from their own doings, nor from their stubborn
           way.

07:002:020 And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel; and he said,
           Because that this people hath transgressed my covenant which I
           commanded their fathers, and have not hearkened unto my voice;

07:002:021 I also will not henceforth drive out any from before them of
           the nations which Joshua left when he died:

07:002:022 That through them I may prove Israel, whether they will keep
           the way of the LORD to walk therein, as their fathers did keep
           it, or not.

07:002:023 Therefore the LORD left those nations, without driving them
           out hastily; neither delivered he them into the hand of
           Joshua.

07:003:001 Now these are the nations which the LORD left, to prove Israel
           by them, even as many of Israel as had not known all the wars
           of Canaan;

07:003:002 Only that the generations of the children of Israel might
           know, to teach them war, at the least such as before knew
           nothing thereof;

07:003:003 Namely, five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites,
           and the Sidonians, and the Hivites that dwelt in mount
           Lebanon, from mount Baalhermon unto the entering in of Hamath.

07:003:004 And they were to prove Israel by them, to know whether they
           would hearken unto the commandments of the LORD, which he
           commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses.

07:003:005 And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites,
           Hittites, and Amorites, and Perizzites, and Hivites, and
           Jebusites:

07:003:006 And they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave
           their daughters to their sons, and served their gods.

07:003:007 And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD,
           and forgat the LORD their God, and served Baalim and the
           groves.

07:003:008 Therefore the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he
           sold them into the hand of Chushanrishathaim king of
           Mesopotamia: and the children of Israel served
           Chushanrishathaim eight years.

07:003:009 And when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD
           raised up a deliverer to the children of Israel, who delivered
           them, even Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother.

07:003:010 And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he judged
           Israel, and went out to war: and the LORD delivered
           Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand; and his
           hand prevailed against Chushanrishathaim.

07:003:011 And the land had rest forty years. And Othniel the son of
           Kenaz died.

07:003:012 And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the
           LORD: and the LORD strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against
           Israel, because they had done evil in the sight of the LORD.

07:003:013 And he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and Amalek, and
           went and smote Israel, and possessed the city of palm trees.

07:003:014 So the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab
           eighteen years.

07:003:015 But when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD
           raised them up a deliverer, Ehud the son of Gera, a Benjamite,
           a man lefthanded: and by him the children of Israel sent a
           present unto Eglon the king of Moab.

07:003:016 But Ehud made him a dagger which had two edges, of a cubit
           length; and he did gird it under his raiment upon his right
           thigh.

07:003:017 And he brought the present unto Eglon king of Moab: and Eglon
           was a very fat man.

07:003:018 And when he had made an end to offer the present, he sent away
           the people that bare the present.

07:003:019 But he himself turned again from the quarries that were by
           Gilgal, and said, I have a secret errand unto thee, O king:
           who said, Keep silence. And all that stood by him went out
           from him.

07:003:020 And Ehud came unto him; and he was sitting in a summer
           parlour, which he had for himself alone. And Ehud said, I have
           a message from God unto thee. And he arose out of his seat.

07:003:021 And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the dagger from his
           right thigh, and thrust it into his belly:

07:003:022 And the haft also went in after the blade; and the fat closed
           upon the blade, so that he could not draw the dagger out of
           his belly; and the dirt came out.

07:003:023 Then Ehud went forth through the porch, and shut the doors of
           the parlour upon him, and locked them.

07:003:024 When he was gone out, his servants came; and when they saw
           that, behold, the doors of the parlour were locked, they said,
           Surely he covereth his feet in his summer chamber.

07:003:025 And they tarried till they were ashamed: and, behold, he
           opened not the doors of the parlour; therefore they took a
           key, and opened them: and, behold, their lord was fallen down
           dead on the earth.

07:003:026 And Ehud escaped while they tarried, and passed beyond the
           quarries, and escaped unto Seirath.

07:003:027 And it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a trumpet
           in the mountain of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went
           down with him from the mount, and he before them.

07:003:028 And he said unto them, Follow after me: for the LORD hath
           delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. And they
           went down after him, and took the fords of Jordan toward Moab,
           and suffered not a man to pass over.

07:003:029 And they slew of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, all
           lusty, and all men of valour; and there escaped not a man.

07:003:030 So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the
           land had rest fourscore years.

07:003:031 And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, which slew of the
           Philistines six hundred men with an ox goad: and he also
           delivered Israel.

07:004:001 And the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the
           LORD, when Ehud was dead.

07:004:002 And the LORD sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan,
           that reigned in Hazor; the captain of whose host was Sisera,
           which dwelt in Harosheth of the Gentiles.

07:004:003 And the children of Israel cried unto the LORD: for he had
           nine hundred chariots of iron; and twenty years he mightily
           oppressed the children of Israel.

07:004:004 And Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, she judged
           Israel at that time.

07:004:005 And she dwelt under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and
           Bethel in mount Ephraim: and the children of Israel came up to
           her for judgment.

07:004:006 And she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of
           Kedeshnaphtali, and said unto him, Hath not the LORD God of
           Israel commanded, saying, Go and draw toward mount Tabor, and
           take with thee ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali
           and of the children of Zebulun?

07:004:007 And I will draw unto thee to the river Kishon Sisera, the
           captain of Jabin's army, with his chariots and his multitude;
           and I will deliver him into thine hand.

07:004:008 And Barak said unto her, If thou wilt go with me, then I will
           go: but if thou wilt not go with me, then I will not go.

07:004:009 And she said, I will surely go with thee: notwithstanding the
           journey that thou takest shall not be for thine honour; for
           the LORD shall sell Sisera into the hand of a woman. And
           Deborah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh.

07:004:010 And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh; and he went
           up with ten thousand men at his feet: and Deborah went up with
           him.

07:004:011 Now Heber the Kenite, which was of the children of Hobab the
           father in law of Moses, had severed himself from the Kenites,
           and pitched his tent unto the plain of Zaanaim, which is by
           Kedesh.

07:004:012 And they shewed Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone
           up to mount Tabor.

07:004:013 And Sisera gathered together all his chariots, even nine
           hundred chariots of iron, and all the people that were with
           him, from Harosheth of the Gentiles unto the river of Kishon.

07:004:014 And Deborah said unto Barak, Up; for this is the day in which
           the LORD hath delivered Sisera into thine hand: is not the
           LORD gone out before thee? So Barak went down from mount
           Tabor, and ten thousand men after him.

07:004:015 And the LORD discomfited Sisera, and all his chariots, and all
           his host, with the edge of the sword before Barak; so that
           Sisera lighted down off his chariot, and fled away on his
           feet.

07:004:016 But Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the host, unto
           Harosheth of the Gentiles: and all the host of Sisera fell
           upon the edge of the sword; and there was not a man left.

07:004:017 Howbeit Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the
           wife of Heber the Kenite: for there was peace between Jabin
           the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.

07:004:018 And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said unto him, Turn in,
           my lord, turn in to me; fear not. And when he had turned in
           unto her into the tent, she covered him with a mantle.

07:004:019 And he said unto her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water to
           drink; for I am thirsty. And she opened a bottle of milk, and
           gave him drink, and covered him.

07:004:020 Again he said unto her, Stand in the door of the tent, and it
           shall be, when any man doth come and enquire of thee, and say,
           Is there any man here? that thou shalt say, No.

07:004:021 Then Jael Heber's wife took a nail of the tent, and took an
           hammer in her hand, and went softly unto him, and smote the
           nail into his temples, and fastened it into the ground: for he
           was fast asleep and weary. So he died.

07:004:022 And, behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet
           him, and said unto him, Come, and I will shew thee the man
           whom thou seekest. And when he came into her tent, behold,
           Sisera lay dead, and the nail was in his temples.

07:004:023 So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the
           children of Israel.

07:004:024 And the hand of the children of Israel prospered, and
           prevailed against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had
           destroyed Jabin king of Canaan.

07:005:001 Then sang Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam on that day,
           saying,

07:005:002 Praise ye the LORD for the avenging of Israel, when the people
           willingly offered themselves.

07:005:003 Hear, O ye kings; give ear, O ye princes; I, even I, will sing
           unto the LORD; I will sing praise to the LORD God of Israel.

07:005:004 LORD, when thou wentest out of Seir, when thou marchedst out
           of the field of Edom, the earth trembled, and the heavens
           dropped, the clouds also dropped water.

07:005:005 The mountains melted from before the LORD, even that Sinai
           from before the LORD God of Israel.

07:005:006 In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, in the days of Jael,
           the highways were unoccupied, and the travellers walked
           through byways.

07:005:007 The inhabitants of the villages ceased, they ceased in Israel,
           until that I Deborah arose, that I arose a mother in Israel.

07:005:008 They chose new gods; then was war in the gates: was there a
           shield or spear seen among forty thousand in Israel?

07:005:009 My heart is toward the governors of Israel, that offered
           themselves willingly among the people. Bless ye the LORD.

07:005:010 Speak, ye that ride on white asses, ye that sit in judgment,
           and walk by the way.

07:005:011 They that are delivered from the noise of archers in the
           places of drawing water, there shall they rehearse the
           righteous acts of the LORD, even the righteous acts toward the
           inhabitants of his villages in Israel: then shall the people
           of the LORD go down to the gates.

07:005:012 Awake, awake, Deborah: awake, awake, utter a song: arise,
           Barak, and lead thy captivity captive, thou son of Abinoam.

07:005:013 Then he made him that remaineth have dominion over the nobles
           among the people: the LORD made me have dominion over the
           mighty.

07:005:014 Out of Ephraim was there a root of them against Amalek; after
           thee, Benjamin, among thy people; out of Machir came down
           governors, and out of Zebulun they that handle the pen of the
           writer.

07:005:015 And the princes of Issachar were with Deborah; even Issachar,
           and also Barak: he was sent on foot into the valley. For the
           divisions of Reuben there were great thoughts of heart.

07:005:016 Why abodest thou among the sheepfolds, to hear the bleatings
           of the flocks? For the divisions of Reuben there were great
           searchings of heart.

07:005:017 Gilead abode beyond Jordan: and why did Dan remain in ships?
           Asher continued on the sea shore, and abode in his breaches.

07:005:018 Zebulun and Naphtali were a people that jeoparded their lives
           unto the death in the high places of the field.

07:005:019 The kings came and fought, then fought the kings of Canaan in
           Taanach by the waters of Megiddo; they took no gain of money.

07:005:020 They fought from heaven; the stars in their courses fought
           against Sisera.

07:005:021 The river of Kishon swept them away, that ancient river, the
           river Kishon. O my soul, thou hast trodden down strength.

07:005:022 Then were the horsehoofs broken by the means of the pransings,
           the pransings of their mighty ones.

07:005:023 Curse ye Meroz, said the angel of the LORD, curse ye bitterly
           the inhabitants thereof; because they came not to the help of
           the LORD, to the help of the LORD against the mighty.

07:005:024 Blessed above women shall Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite
           be, blessed shall she be above women in the tent.

07:005:025 He asked water, and she gave him milk; she brought forth
           butter in a lordly dish.

07:005:026 She put her hand to the nail, and her right hand to the
           workmen's hammer; and with the hammer she smote Sisera, she
           smote off his head, when she had pierced and stricken through
           his temples.

07:005:027 At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay down: at her feet he
           bowed, he fell: where he bowed, there he fell down dead.

07:005:028 The mother of Sisera looked out at a window, and cried through
           the lattice, Why is his chariot so long in coming? why tarry
           the wheels of his chariots?

07:005:029 Her wise ladies answered her, yea, she returned answer to
           herself,

07:005:030 Have they not sped? have they not divided the prey; to every
           man a damsel or two; to Sisera a prey of divers colours, a
           prey of divers colours of needlework, of divers colours of
           needlework on both sides, meet for the necks of them that take
           the spoil?

07:005:031 So let all thine enemies perish, O LORD: but let them that
           love him be as the sun when he goeth forth in his might. And
           the land had rest forty years.

07:006:001 And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD:
           and the LORD delivered them into the hand of Midian seven
           years.

07:006:002 And the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel: and because
           of the Midianites the children of Israel made them the dens
           which are in the mountains, and caves, and strong holds.

07:006:003 And so it was, when Israel had sown, that the Midianites came
           up, and the Amalekites, and the children of the east, even
           they came up against them;

07:006:004 And they encamped against them, and destroyed the increase of
           the earth, till thou come unto Gaza, and left no sustenance
           for Israel, neither sheep, nor ox, nor ass.

07:006:005 For they came up with their cattle and their tents, and they
           came as grasshoppers for multitude; for both they and their
           camels were without number: and they entered into the land to
           destroy it.

07:006:006 And Israel was greatly impoverished because of the Midianites;
           and the children of Israel cried unto the LORD.

07:006:007 And it came to pass, when the children of Israel cried unto
           the LORD because of the Midianites,

07:006:008 That the LORD sent a prophet unto the children of Israel,
           which said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I
           brought you up from Egypt, and brought you forth out of the
           house of bondage;

07:006:009 And I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out
           of the hand of all that oppressed you, and drave them out from
           before you, and gave you their land;

07:006:010 And I said unto you, I am the LORD your God; fear not the gods
           of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but ye have not
           obeyed my voice.

07:006:011 And there came an angel of the LORD, and sat under an oak
           which was in Ophrah, that pertained unto Joash the Abiezrite:
           and his son Gideon threshed wheat by the winepress, to hide it
           from the Midianites.

07:006:012 And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him, and said unto
           him, The LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour.

07:006:013 And Gideon said unto him, Oh my Lord, if the LORD be with us,
           why then is all this befallen us? and where be all his
           miracles which our fathers told us of, saying, Did not the
           LORD bring us up from Egypt? but now the LORD hath forsaken
           us, and delivered us into the hands of the Midianites.

07:006:014 And the LORD looked upon him, and said, Go in this thy might,
           and thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the Midianites:
           have not I sent thee?

07:006:015 And he said unto him, Oh my Lord, wherewith shall I save
           Israel? behold, my family is poor in Manasseh, and I am the
           least in my father's house.

07:006:016 And the LORD said unto him, Surely I will be with thee, and
           thou shalt smite the Midianites as one man.

07:006:017 And he said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight,
           then shew me a sign that thou talkest with me.

07:006:018 Depart not hence, I pray thee, until I come unto thee, and
           bring forth my present, and set it before thee. And he said, I
           will tarry until thou come again.

07:006:019 And Gideon went in, and made ready a kid, and unleavened cakes
           of an ephah of flour: the flesh he put in a basket, and he put
           the broth in a pot, and brought it out unto him under the oak,
           and presented it.

07:006:020 And the angel of God said unto him, Take the flesh and the
           unleavened cakes, and lay them upon this rock, and pour out
           the broth. And he did so.

07:006:021 Then the angel of the LORD put forth the end of the staff that
           was in his hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened
           cakes; and there rose up fire out of the rock, and consumed
           the flesh and the unleavened cakes. Then the angel of the LORD
           departed out of his sight.

07:006:022 And when Gideon perceived that he was an angel of the LORD,
           Gideon said, Alas, O LORD God! for because I have seen an
           angel of the LORD face to face.

07:006:023 And the LORD said unto him, Peace be unto thee; fear not: thou
           shalt not die.

07:006:024 Then Gideon built an altar there unto the LORD, and called it
           Jehovahshalom: unto this day it is yet in Ophrah of the
           Abiezrites.

07:006:025 And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said unto
           him, Take thy father's young bullock, even the second bullock
           of seven years old, and throw down the altar of Baal that thy
           father hath, and cut down the grove that is by it:

07:006:026 And build an altar unto the LORD thy God upon the top of this
           rock, in the ordered place, and take the second bullock, and
           offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of the grove which thou
           shalt cut down.

07:006:027 Then Gideon took ten men of his servants, and did as the LORD
           had said unto him: and so it was, because he feared his
           father's household, and the men of the city, that he could not
           do it by day, that he did it by night.

07:006:028 And when the men of the city arose early in the morning,
           behold, the altar of Baal was cast down, and the grove was cut
           down that was by it, and the second bullock was offered upon
           the altar that was built.

07:006:029 And they said one to another, Who hath done this thing? And
           when they enquired and asked, they said, Gideon the son of
           Joash hath done this thing.

07:006:030 Then the men of the city said unto Joash, Bring out thy son,
           that he may die: because he hath cast down the altar of Baal,
           and because he hath cut down the grove that was by it.

07:006:031 And Joash said unto all that stood against him, Will ye plead
           for Baal? will ye save him? he that will plead for him, let
           him be put to death whilst it is yet morning: if he be a god,
           let him plead for himself, because one hath cast down his
           altar.

07:006:032 Therefore on that day he called him Jerubbaal, saying, Let
           Baal plead against him, because he hath thrown down his altar.

07:006:033 Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children of
           the east were gathered together, and went over, and pitched in
           the valley of Jezreel.

07:006:034 But the Spirit of the LORD came upon Gideon, and he blew a
           trumpet; and Abiezer was gathered after him.

07:006:035 And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh; who also was
           gathered after him: and he sent messengers unto Asher, and
           unto Zebulun, and unto Naphtali; and they came up to meet
           them.

07:006:036 And Gideon said unto God, If thou wilt save Israel by mine
           hand, as thou hast said,

07:006:037 Behold, I will put a fleece of wool in the floor; and if the
           dew be on the fleece only, and it be dry upon all the earth
           beside, then shall I know that thou wilt save Israel by mine
           hand, as thou hast said.

07:006:038 And it was so: for he rose up early on the morrow, and thrust
           the fleece together, and wringed the dew out of the fleece, a
           bowl full of water.

07:006:039 And Gideon said unto God, Let not thine anger be hot against
           me, and I will speak but this once: let me prove, I pray thee,
           but this once with the fleece; let it now be dry only upon the
           fleece, and upon all the ground let there be dew.

07:006:040 And God did so that night: for it was dry upon the fleece
           only, and there was dew on all the ground.

07:007:001 Then Jerubbaal, who is Gideon, and all the people that were
           with him, rose up early, and pitched beside the well of Harod:
           so that the host of the Midianites were on the north side of
           them, by the hill of Moreh, in the valley.

07:007:002 And the LORD said unto Gideon, The people that are with thee
           are too many for me to give the Midianites into their hands,
           lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, Mine own hand
           hath saved me.

07:007:003 Now therefore go to, proclaim in the ears of the people,
           saying, Whosoever is fearful and afraid, let him return and
           depart early from mount Gilead. And there returned of the
           people twenty and two thousand; and there remained ten
           thousand.

07:007:004 And the LORD said unto Gideon, The people are yet too many;
           bring them down unto the water, and I will try them for thee
           there: and it shall be, that of whom I say unto thee, This
           shall go with thee, the same shall go with thee; and of
           whomsoever I say unto thee, This shall not go with thee, the
           same shall not go.

07:007:005 So he brought down the people unto the water: and the LORD
           said unto Gideon, Every one that lappeth of the water with his
           tongue, as a dog lappeth, him shalt thou set by himself;
           likewise every one that boweth down upon his knees to drink.

07:007:006 And the number of them that lapped, putting their hand to
           their mouth, were three hundred men: but all the rest of the
           people bowed down upon their knees to drink water.

07:007:007 And the LORD said unto Gideon, By the three hundred men that
           lapped will I save you, and deliver the Midianites into thine
           hand: and let all the other people go every man unto his
           place.

07:007:008 So the people took victuals in their hand, and their trumpets:
           and he sent all the rest of Israel every man unto his tent,
           and retained those three hundred men: and the host of Midian
           was beneath him in the valley.

07:007:009 And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said unto
           him, Arise, get thee down unto the host; for I have delivered
           it into thine hand.

07:007:010 But if thou fear to go down, go thou with Phurah thy servant
           down to the host:

07:007:011 And thou shalt hear what they say; and afterward shall thine
           hands be strengthened to go down unto the host. Then went he
           down with Phurah his servant unto the outside of the armed men
           that were in the host.

07:007:012 And the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of
           the east lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for
           multitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand
           by the sea side for multitude.

07:007:013 And when Gideon was come, behold, there was a man that told a
           dream unto his fellow, and said, Behold, I dreamed a dream,
           and, lo, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the host of
           Midian, and came unto a tent, and smote it that it fell, and
           overturned it, that the tent lay along.

07:007:014 And his fellow answered and said, This is nothing else save
           the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel: for
           into his hand hath God delivered Midian, and all the host.

07:007:015 And it was so, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream, and
           the interpretation thereof, that he worshipped, and returned
           into the host of Israel, and said, Arise; for the LORD hath
           delivered into your hand the host of Midian.

07:007:016 And he divided the three hundred men into three companies, and
           he put a trumpet in every man's hand, with empty pitchers, and
           lamps within the pitchers.

07:007:017 And he said unto them, Look on me, and do likewise: and,
           behold, when I come to the outside of the camp, it shall be
           that, as I do, so shall ye do.

07:007:018 When I blow with a trumpet, I and all that are with me, then
           blow ye the trumpets also on every side of all the camp, and
           say, The sword of the LORD, and of Gideon.

07:007:019 So Gideon, and the hundred men that were with him, came unto
           the outside of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch;
           and they had but newly set the watch: and they blew the
           trumpets, and brake the pitchers that were in their hands.

07:007:020 And the three companies blew the trumpets, and brake the
           pitchers, and held the lamps in their left hands, and the
           trumpets in their right hands to blow withal: and they cried,
           The sword of the LORD, and of Gideon.

07:007:021 And they stood every man in his place round about the camp;
           and all the host ran, and cried, and fled.

07:007:022 And the three hundred blew the trumpets, and the LORD set
           every man's sword against his fellow, even throughout all the
           host: and the host fled to Bethshittah in Zererath, and to the
           border of Abelmeholah, unto Tabbath.

07:007:023 And the men of Israel gathered themselves together out of
           Naphtali, and out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and
           pursued after the Midianites.

07:007:024 And Gideon sent messengers throughout all mount Ephraim,
           saying, come down against the Midianites, and take before them
           the waters unto Bethbarah and Jordan. Then all the men of
           Ephraim gathered themselves together, and took the waters unto
           Bethbarah and Jordan.

07:007:025 And they took two princes of the Midianites, Oreb and Zeeb;
           and they slew Oreb upon the rock Oreb, and Zeeb they slew at
           the winepress of Zeeb, and pursued Midian, and brought the
           heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon on the other side Jordan.

07:008:001 And the men of Ephraim said unto him, Why hast thou served us
           thus, that thou calledst us not, when thou wentest to fight
           with the Midianites? And they did chide with him sharply.

07:008:002 And he said unto them, What have I done now in comparison of
           you? Is not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than
           the vintage of Abiezer?

07:008:003 God hath delivered into your hands the princes of Midian, Oreb
           and Zeeb: and what was I able to do in comparison of you? Then
           their anger was abated toward him, when he had said that.

07:008:004 And Gideon came to Jordan, and passed over, he, and the three
           hundred men that were with him, faint, yet pursuing them.

07:008:005 And he said unto the men of Succoth, Give, I pray you, loaves
           of bread unto the people that follow me; for they be faint,
           and I am pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna, kings of Midian.

07:008:006 And the princes of Succoth said, Are the hands of Zebah and
           Zalmunna now in thine hand, that we should give bread unto
           thine army?

07:008:007 And Gideon said, Therefore when the LORD hath delivered Zebah
           and Zalmunna into mine hand, then I will tear your flesh with
           the thorns of the wilderness and with briers.

07:008:008 And he went up thence to Penuel, and spake unto them likewise:
           and the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had
           answered him.

07:008:009 And he spake also unto the men of Penuel, saying, When I come
           again in peace, I will break down this tower.

07:008:010 Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and their hosts with
           them, about fifteen thousand men, all that were left of all
           the hosts of the children of the east: for there fell an
           hundred and twenty thousand men that drew sword.

07:008:011 And Gideon went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents on
           the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and smote the host; for the
           host was secure.

07:008:012 And when Zebah and Zalmunna fled, he pursued after them, and
           took the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and
           discomfited all the host.

07:008:013 And Gideon the son of Joash returned from battle before the
           sun was up,

07:008:014 And caught a young man of the men of Succoth, and enquired of
           him: and he described unto him the princes of Succoth, and the
           elders thereof, even threescore and seventeen men.

07:008:015 And he came unto the men of Succoth, and said, Behold Zebah
           and Zalmunna, with whom ye did upbraid me, saying, Are the
           hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thine hand, that we should
           give bread unto thy men that are weary?

07:008:016 And he took the elders of the city, and thorns of the
           wilderness and briers, and with them he taught the men of
           Succoth.

07:008:017 And he beat down the tower of Penuel, and slew the men of the
           city.

07:008:018 Then said he unto Zebah and Zalmunna, What manner of men were
           they whom ye slew at Tabor? And they answered, As thou art, so
           were they; each one resembled the children of a king.

07:008:019 And he said, They were my brethren, even the sons of my
           mother: as the LORD liveth, if ye had saved them alive, I
           would not slay you.

07:008:020 And he said unto Jether his firstborn, Up, and slay them. But
           the youth drew not his sword: for he feared, because he was
           yet a youth.

07:008:021 Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, Rise thou, and fall upon us: for
           as the man is, so is his strength. And Gideon arose, and slew
           Zebah and Zalmunna, and took away the ornaments that were on
           their camels' necks.

07:008:022 Then the men of Israel said unto Gideon, Rule thou over us,
           both thou, and thy son, and thy son's son also: for thou hast
           delivered us from the hand of Midian.

07:008:023 And Gideon said unto them, I will not rule over you, neither
           shall my son rule over you: the LORD shall rule over you.

07:008:024 And Gideon said unto them, I would desire a request of you,
           that ye would give me every man the earrings of his prey. (For
           they had golden earrings, because they were Ishmaelites.)

07:008:025 And they answered, We will willingly give them. And they
           spread a garment, and did cast therein every man the earrings
           of his prey.

07:008:026 And the weight of the golden earrings that he requested was a
           thousand and seven hundred shekels of gold; beside ornaments,
           and collars, and purple raiment that was on the kings of
           Midian, and beside the chains that were about their camels'
           necks.

07:008:027 And Gideon made an ephod thereof, and put it in his city, even
           in Ophrah: and all Israel went thither a whoring after it:
           which thing became a snare unto Gideon, and to his house.

07:008:028 Thus was Midian subdued before the children of Israel, so that
           they lifted up their heads no more. And the country was in
           quietness forty years in the days of Gideon.

07:008:029 And Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and dwelt in his own
           house.

07:008:030 And Gideon had threescore and ten sons of his body begotten:
           for he had many wives.

07:008:031 And his concubine that was in Shechem, she also bare him a
           son, whose name he called Abimelech.

07:008:032 And Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age, and was
           buried in the sepulchre of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the
           Abiezrites.

07:008:033 And it came to pass, as soon as Gideon was dead, that the
           children of Israel turned again, and went a whoring after
           Baalim, and made Baalberith their god.

07:008:034 And the children of Israel remembered not the LORD their God,
           who had delivered them out of the hands of all their enemies
           on every side:

07:008:035 Neither shewed they kindness to the house of Jerubbaal,
           namely, Gideon, according to all the goodness which he had
           shewed unto Israel.

07:009:001 And Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem unto his
           mother's brethren, and communed with them, and with all the
           family of the house of his mother's father, saying,

07:009:002 Speak, I pray you, in the ears of all the men of Shechem,
           Whether is better for you, either that all the sons of
           Jerubbaal, which are threescore and ten persons, reign over
           you, or that one reign over you? remember also that I am your
           bone and your flesh.

07:009:003 And his mother's brethren spake of him in the ears of all the
           men of Shechem all these words: and their hearts inclined to
           follow Abimelech; for they said, He is our brother.

07:009:004 And they gave him threescore and ten pieces of silver out of
           the house of Baalberith, wherewith Abimelech hired vain and
           light persons, which followed him.

07:009:005 And he went unto his father's house at Ophrah, and slew his
           brethren the sons of Jerubbaal, being threescore and ten
           persons, upon one stone: notwithstanding yet Jotham the
           youngest son of Jerubbaal was left; for he hid himself.

07:009:006 And all the men of Shechem gathered together, and all the
           house of Millo, and went, and made Abimelech king, by the
           plain of the pillar that was in Shechem.

07:009:007 And when they told it to Jotham, he went and stood in the top
           of mount Gerizim, and lifted up his voice, and cried, and said
           unto them, Hearken unto me, ye men of Shechem, that God may
           hearken unto you.

07:009:008 The trees went forth on a time to anoint a king over them; and
           they said unto the olive tree, Reign thou over us.

07:009:009 But the olive tree said unto them, Should I leave my fatness,
           wherewith by me they honour God and man, and go to be promoted
           over the trees?

07:009:010 And the trees said to the fig tree, Come thou, and reign over
           us.

07:009:011 But the fig tree said unto them, Should I forsake my
           sweetness, and my good fruit, and go to be promoted over the
           trees?

07:009:012 Then said the trees unto the vine, Come thou, and reign over
           us.

07:009:013 And the vine said unto them, Should I leave my wine, which
           cheereth God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees?

07:009:014 Then said all the trees unto the bramble, Come thou, and reign
           over us.

07:009:015 And the bramble said unto the trees, If in truth ye anoint me
           king over you, then come and put your trust in my shadow: and
           if not, let fire come out of the bramble, and devour the
           cedars of Lebanon.

07:009:016 Now therefore, if ye have done truly and sincerely, in that ye
           have made Abimelech king, and if ye have dealt well with
           Jerubbaal and his house, and have done unto him according to
           the deserving of his hands;

07:009:017 (For my father fought for you, and adventured his life far,
           and delivered you out of the hand of Midian:

07:009:018 And ye are risen up against my father's house this day, and
           have slain his sons, threescore and ten persons, upon one
           stone, and have made Abimelech, the son of his maidservant,
           king over the men of Shechem, because he is your brother;)

07:009:019 If ye then have dealt truly and sincerely with Jerubbaal and
           with his house this day, then rejoice ye in Abimelech, and let
           him also rejoice in you:

07:009:020 But if not, let fire come out from Abimelech, and devour the
           men of Shechem, and the house of Millo; and let fire come out
           from the men of Shechem, and from the house of Millo, and
           devour Abimelech.

07:009:021 And Jotham ran away, and fled, and went to Beer, and dwelt
           there, for fear of Abimelech his brother.

07:009:022 When Abimelech had reigned three years over Israel,

07:009:023 Then God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of
           Shechem; and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with
           Abimelech:

07:009:024 That the cruelty done to the threescore and ten sons of
           Jerubbaal might come, and their blood be laid upon Abimelech
           their brother, which slew them; and upon the men of Shechem,
           which aided him in the killing of his brethren.

07:009:025 And the men of Shechem set liers in wait for him in the top of
           the mountains, and they robbed all that came along that way by
           them: and it was told Abimelech.

07:009:026 And Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brethren, and went over
           to Shechem: and the men of Shechem put their confidence in
           him.

07:009:027 And they went out into the fields, and gathered their
           vineyards, and trode the grapes, and made merry, and went into
           the house of their god, and did eat and drink, and cursed
           Abimelech.

07:009:028 And Gaal the son of Ebed said, Who is Abimelech, and who is
           Shechem, that we should serve him? is not he the son of
           Jerubbaal? and Zebul his officer? serve the men of Hamor the
           father of Shechem: for why should we serve him?

07:009:029 And would to God this people were under my hand! then would I
           remove Abimelech. And he said to Abimelech, Increase thine
           army, and come out.

07:009:030 And when Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal
           the son of Ebed, his anger was kindled.

07:009:031 And he sent messengers unto Abimelech privily, saying, Behold,
           Gaal the son of Ebed and his brethren be come to Shechem; and,
           behold, they fortify the city against thee.

07:009:032 Now therefore up by night, thou and the people that is with
           thee, and lie in wait in the field:

07:009:033 And it shall be, that in the morning, as soon as the sun is
           up, thou shalt rise early, and set upon the city: and, behold,
           when he and the people that is with him come out against thee,
           then mayest thou do to them as thou shalt find occasion.

07:009:034 And Abimelech rose up, and all the people that were with him,
           by night, and they laid wait against Shechem in four
           companies.

07:009:035 And Gaal the son of Ebed went out, and stood in the entering
           of the gate of the city: and Abimelech rose up, and the people
           that were with him, from lying in wait.

07:009:036 And when Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, Behold, there
           come people down from the top of the mountains. And Zebul said
           unto him, Thou seest the shadow of the mountains as if they
           were men.

07:009:037 And Gaal spake again, and said, See there come people down by
           the middle of the land, and another company come along by the
           plain of Meonenim.

07:009:038 Then said Zebul unto him, Where is now thy mouth, wherewith
           thou saidst, Who is Abimelech, that we should serve him? is
           not this the people that thou hast despised? go out, I pray
           now, and fight with them.

07:009:039 And Gaal went out before the men of Shechem, and fought with
           Abimelech.

07:009:040 And Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him, and many
           were overthrown and wounded, even unto the entering of the
           gate.

07:009:041 And Abimelech dwelt at Arumah: and Zebul thrust out Gaal and
           his brethren, that they should not dwell in Shechem.

07:009:042 And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people went out
           into the field; and they told Abimelech.

07:009:043 And he took the people, and divided them into three companies,
           and laid wait in the field, and looked, and, behold, the
           people were come forth out of the city; and he rose up against
           them, and smote them.

07:009:044 And Abimelech, and the company that was with him, rushed
           forward, and stood in the entering of the gate of the city:
           and the two other companies ran upon all the people that were
           in the fields, and slew them.

07:009:045 And Abimelech fought against the city all that day; and he
           took the city, and slew the people that was therein, and beat
           down the city, and sowed it with salt.

07:009:046 And when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard that, they
           entered into an hold of the house of the god Berith.

07:009:047 And it was told Abimelech, that all the men of the tower of
           Shechem were gathered together.

07:009:048 And Abimelech gat him up to mount Zalmon, he and all the
           people that were with him; and Abimelech took an axe in his
           hand, and cut down a bough from the trees, and took it, and
           laid it on his shoulder, and said unto the people that were
           with him, What ye have seen me do, make haste, and do as I
           have done.

07:009:049 And all the people likewise cut down every man his bough, and
           followed Abimelech, and put them to the hold, and set the hold
           on fire upon them; so that all the men of the tower of Shechem
           died also, about a thousand men and women.

07:009:050 Then went Abimelech to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez,
           and took it.

07:009:051 But there was a strong tower within the city, and thither fled
           all the men and women, and all they of the city, and shut it
           to them, and gat them up to the top of the tower.

07:009:052 And Abimelech came unto the tower, and fought against it, and
           went hard unto the door of the tower to burn it with fire.

07:009:053 And a certain woman cast a piece of a millstone upon
           Abimelech's head, and all to brake his skull.

07:009:054 Then he called hastily unto the young man his armourbearer,
           and said unto him, Draw thy sword, and slay me, that men say
           not of me, A women slew him. And his young man thrust him
           through, and he died.

07:009:055 And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they
           departed every man unto his place.

07:009:056 Thus God rendered the wickedness of Abimelech, which he did
           unto his father, in slaying his seventy brethren:

07:009:057 And all the evil of the men of Shechem did God render upon
           their heads: and upon them came the curse of Jotham the son of
           Jerubbaal.

07:010:001 And after Abimelech there arose to defend Israel Tola the son
           of Puah, the son of Dodo, a man of Issachar; and he dwelt in
           Shamir in mount Ephraim.

07:010:002 And he judged Israel twenty and three years, and died, and was
           buried in Shamir.

07:010:003 And after him arose Jair, a Gileadite, and judged Israel
           twenty and two years.

07:010:004 And he had thirty sons that rode on thirty ass colts, and they
           had thirty cities, which are called Havothjair unto this day,
           which are in the land of Gilead.

07:010:005 And Jair died, and was buried in Camon.

07:010:006 And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the
           LORD, and served Baalim, and Ashtaroth, and the gods of Syria,
           and the gods of Zidon, and the gods of Moab, and the gods of
           the children of Ammon, and the gods of the Philistines, and
           forsook the LORD, and served not him.

07:010:007 And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he sold
           them into the hands of the Philistines, and into the hands of
           the children of Ammon.

07:010:008 And that year they vexed and oppressed the children of Israel:
           eighteen years, all the children of Israel that were on the
           other side Jordan in the land of the Amorites, which is in
           Gilead.

07:010:009 Moreover the children of Ammon passed over Jordan to fight
           also against Judah, and against Benjamin, and against the
           house of Ephraim; so that Israel was sore distressed.

07:010:010 And the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, saying, We
           have sinned against thee, both because we have forsaken our
           God, and also served Baalim.

07:010:011 And the LORD said unto the children of Israel, Did not I
           deliver you from the Egyptians, and from the Amorites, from
           the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines?

07:010:012 The Zidonians also, and the Amalekites, and the Maonites, did
           oppress you; and ye cried to me, and I delivered you out of
           their hand.

07:010:013 Yet ye have forsaken me, and served other gods: wherefore I
           will deliver you no more.

07:010:014 Go and cry unto the gods which ye have chosen; let them
           deliver you in the time of your tribulation.

07:010:015 And the children of Israel said unto the LORD, We have sinned:
           do thou unto us whatsoever seemeth good unto thee; deliver us
           only, we pray thee, this day.

07:010:016 And they put away the strange gods from among them, and served
           the LORD: and his soul was grieved for the misery of Israel.

07:010:017 Then the children of Ammon were gathered together, and
           encamped in Gilead. And the children of Israel assembled
           themselves together, and encamped in Mizpeh.

07:010:018 And the people and princes of Gilead said one to another, What
           man is he that will begin to fight against the children of
           Ammon? he shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.

07:011:001 Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valour, and he
           was the son of an harlot: and Gilead begat Jephthah.

07:011:002 And Gilead's wife bare him sons; and his wife's sons grew up,
           and they thrust out Jephthah, and said unto him, Thou shalt
           not inherit in our father's house; for thou art the son of a
           strange woman.

07:011:003 Then Jephthah fled from his brethren, and dwelt in the land of
           Tob: and there were gathered vain men to Jephthah, and went
           out with him.

07:011:004 And it came to pass in process of time, that the children of
           Ammon made war against Israel.

07:011:005 And it was so, that when the children of Ammon made war
           against Israel, the elders of Gilead went to fetch Jephthah
           out of the land of Tob:

07:011:006 And they said unto Jephthah, Come, and be our captain, that we
           may fight with the children of Ammon.

07:011:007 And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, Did not ye hate
           me, and expel me out of my father's house? and why are ye come
           unto me now when ye are in distress?

07:011:008 And the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah, Therefore we turn
           again to thee now, that thou mayest go with us, and fight
           against the children of Ammon, and be our head over all the
           inhabitants of Gilead.

07:011:009 And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, If ye bring me
           home again to fight against the children of Ammon, and the
           LORD deliver them before me, shall I be your head?

07:011:010 And the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah, The LORD be
           witness between us, if we do not so according to thy words.

07:011:011 Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people
           made him head and captain over them: and Jephthah uttered all
           his words before the LORD in Mizpeh.

07:011:012 And Jephthah sent messengers unto the king of the children of
           Ammon, saying, What hast thou to do with me, that thou art
           come against me to fight in my land?

07:011:013 And the king of the children of Ammon answered unto the
           messengers of Jephthah, Because Israel took away my land, when
           they came up out of Egypt, from Arnon even unto Jabbok, and
           unto Jordan: now therefore restore those lands again
           peaceably.

07:011:014 And Jephthah sent messengers again unto the king of the
           children of Ammon:

07:011:015 And said unto him, Thus saith Jephthah, Israel took not away
           the land of Moab, nor the land of the children of Ammon:

07:011:016 But when Israel came up from Egypt, and walked through the
           wilderness unto the Red sea, and came to Kadesh;

07:011:017 Then Israel sent messengers unto the king of Edom, saying, Let
           me, I pray thee, pass through thy land: but the king of Edom
           would not hearken thereto. And in like manner they sent unto
           the king of Moab: but he would not consent: and Israel abode
           in Kadesh.

07:011:018 Then they went along through the wilderness, and compassed the
           land of Edom, and the land of Moab, and came by the east side
           of the land of Moab, and pitched on the other side of Arnon,
           but came not within the border of Moab: for Arnon was the
           border of Moab.

07:011:019 And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites,
           the king of Heshbon; and Israel said unto him, Let us pass, we
           pray thee, through thy land into my place.

07:011:020 But Sihon trusted not Israel to pass through his coast: but
           Sihon gathered all his people together, and pitched in Jahaz,
           and fought against Israel.

07:011:021 And the LORD God of Israel delivered Sihon and all his people
           into the hand of Israel, and they smote them: so Israel
           possessed all the land of the Amorites, the inhabitants of
           that country.

07:011:022 And they possessed all the coasts of the Amorites, from Arnon
           even unto Jabbok, and from the wilderness even unto Jordan.

07:011:023 So now the LORD God of Israel hath dispossessed the Amorites
           from before his people Israel, and shouldest thou possess it?

07:011:024 Wilt not thou possess that which Chemosh thy god giveth thee
           to possess? So whomsoever the LORD our God shall drive out
           from before us, them will we possess.

07:011:025 And now art thou any thing better than Balak the son of
           Zippor, king of Moab? did he ever strive against Israel, or
           did he ever fight against them,

07:011:026 While Israel dwelt in Heshbon and her towns, and in Aroer and
           her towns, and in all the cities that be along by the coasts
           of Arnon, three hundred years? why therefore did ye not
           recover them within that time?

07:011:027 Wherefore I have not sinned against thee, but thou doest me
           wrong to war against me: the LORD the Judge be judge this day
           between the children of Israel and the children of Ammon.

07:011:028 Howbeit the king of the children of Ammon hearkened not unto
           the words of Jephthah which he sent him.

07:011:029 Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon Jephthah, and he passed
           over Gilead, and Manasseh, and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead,
           and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over unto the children of
           Ammon.

07:011:030 And Jephthah vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If thou
           shalt without fail deliver the children of Ammon into mine
           hands,

07:011:031 Then it shall be, that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of
           my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children
           of Ammon, shall surely be the LORD's, and I will offer it up
           for a burnt offering.

07:011:032 So Jephthah passed over unto the children of Ammon to fight
           against them; and the LORD delivered them into his hands.

07:011:033 And he smote them from Aroer, even till thou come to Minnith,
           even twenty cities, and unto the plain of the vineyards, with
           a very great slaughter. Thus the children of Ammon were
           subdued before the children of Israel.

07:011:034 And Jephthah came to Mizpeh unto his house, and, behold, his
           daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances:
           and she was his only child; beside her he had neither son nor
           daughter.

07:011:035 And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he rent his
           clothes, and said, Alas, my daughter! thou hast brought me
           very low, and thou art one of them that trouble me: for I have
           opened my mouth unto the LORD, and I cannot go back.

07:011:036 And she said unto him, My father, if thou hast opened thy
           mouth unto the LORD, do to me according to that which hath
           proceeded out of thy mouth; forasmuch as the LORD hath taken
           vengeance for thee of thine enemies, even of the children of
           Ammon.

07:011:037 And she said unto her father, Let this thing be done for me:
           let me alone two months, that I may go up and down upon the
           mountains, and bewail my virginity, I and my fellows.

07:011:038 And he said, Go. And he sent her away for two months: and she
           went with her companions, and bewailed her virginity upon the
           mountains.

07:011:039 And it came to pass at the end of two months, that she
           returned unto her father, who did with her according to his
           vow which he had vowed: and she knew no man. And it was a
           custom in Israel,

07:011:040 That the daughters of Israel went yearly to lament the
           daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in a year.

07:012:001 And the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together, and went
           northward, and said unto Jephthah, Wherefore passedst thou
           over to fight against the children of Ammon, and didst not
           call us to go with thee? we will burn thine house upon thee
           with fire.

07:012:002 And Jephthah said unto them, I and my people were at great
           strife with the children of Ammon; and when I called you, ye
           delivered me not out of their hands.

07:012:003 And when I saw that ye delivered me not, I put my life in my
           hands, and passed over against the children of Ammon, and the
           LORD delivered them into my hand: wherefore then are ye come
           up unto me this day, to fight against me?

07:012:004 Then Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead, and
           fought with Ephraim: and the men of Gilead smote Ephraim,
           because they said, Ye Gileadites are fugitives of Ephraim
           among the Ephraimites, and among the Manassites.

07:012:005 And the Gileadites took the passages of Jordan before the
           Ephraimites: and it was so, that when those Ephraimites which
           were escaped said, Let me go over; that the men of Gilead said
           unto him, Art thou an Ephraimite? If he said, Nay;

07:012:006 Then said they unto him, Say now Shibboleth: and he said
           Sibboleth: for he could not frame to pronounce it right. Then
           they took him, and slew him at the passages of Jordan: and
           there fell at that time of the Ephraimites forty and two
           thousand.

07:012:007 And Jephthah judged Israel six years. Then died Jephthah the
           Gileadite, and was buried in one of the cities of Gilead.

07:012:008 And after him Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel.

07:012:009 And he had thirty sons, and thirty daughters, whom he sent
           abroad, and took in thirty daughters from abroad for his sons.
           And he judged Israel seven years.

07:012:010 Then died Ibzan, and was buried at Bethlehem.

07:012:011 And after him Elon, a Zebulonite, judged Israel; and he judged
           Israel ten years.

07:012:012 And Elon the Zebulonite died, and was buried in Aijalon in the
           country of Zebulun.

07:012:013 And after him Abdon the son of Hillel, a Pirathonite, judged
           Israel.

07:012:014 And he had forty sons and thirty nephews, that rode on
           threescore and ten ass colts: and he judged Israel eight
           years.

07:012:015 And Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died, and was
           buried in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the mount of the
           Amalekites.

07:013:001 And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the
           LORD; and the LORD delivered them into the hand of the
           Philistines forty years.

07:013:002 And there was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the
           Danites, whose name was Manoah; and his wife was barren, and
           bare not.

07:013:003 And the angel of the LORD appeared unto the woman, and said
           unto her, Behold now, thou art barren, and bearest not: but
           thou shalt conceive, and bear a son.

07:013:004 Now therefore beware, I pray thee, and drink not wine nor
           strong drink, and eat not any unclean thing:

07:013:005 For, lo, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and no razor
           shall come on his head: for the child shall be a Nazarite unto
           God from the womb: and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of
           the hand of the Philistines.

07:013:006 Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of God
           came unto me, and his countenance was like the countenance of
           an angel of God, very terrible: but I asked him not whence he
           was, neither told he me his name:

07:013:007 But he said unto me, Behold, thou shalt conceive, and bear a
           son; and now drink no wine nor strong drink, neither eat any
           unclean thing: for the child shall be a Nazarite to God from
           the womb to the day of his death.

07:013:008 Then Manoah intreated the LORD, and said, O my Lord, let the
           man of God which thou didst send come again unto us, and teach
           us what we shall do unto the child that shall be born.

07:013:009 And God hearkened to the voice of Manoah; and the angel of God
           came again unto the woman as she sat in the field: but Manoah
           her husband was not with her.

07:013:010 And the woman made haste, and ran, and shewed her husband, and
           said unto him, Behold, the man hath appeared unto me, that
           came unto me the other day.

07:013:011 And Manoah arose, and went after his wife, and came to the
           man, and said unto him, Art thou the man that spakest unto the
           woman? And he said, I am.

07:013:012 And Manoah said, Now let thy words come to pass. How shall we
           order the child, and how shall we do unto him?

07:013:013 And the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah, Of all that I said
           unto the woman let her beware.

07:013:014 She may not eat of any thing that cometh of the vine, neither
           let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing:
           all that I commanded her let her observe.

07:013:015 And Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD, I pray thee, let
           us detain thee, until we shall have made ready a kid for thee.

07:013:016 And the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah, Though thou detain
           me, I will not eat of thy bread: and if thou wilt offer a
           burnt offering, thou must offer it unto the LORD. For Manoah
           knew not that he was an angel of the LORD.

07:013:017 And Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD, What is thy name,
           that when thy sayings come to pass we may do thee honour?

07:013:018 And the angel of the LORD said unto him, Why askest thou thus
           after my name, seeing it is secret?

07:013:019 So Manoah took a kid with a meat offering, and offered it upon
           a rock unto the LORD: and the angel did wonderously; and
           Manoah and his wife looked on.

07:013:020 For it came to pass, when the flame went up toward heaven from
           off the altar, that the angel of the LORD ascended in the
           flame of the altar. And Manoah and his wife looked on it, and
           fell on their faces to the ground.

07:013:021 But the angel of the LORD did no more appear to Manoah and to
           his wife. Then Manoah knew that he was an angel of the LORD.

07:013:022 And Manoah said unto his wife, We shall surely die, because we
           have seen God.

07:013:023 But his wife said unto him, If the LORD were pleased to kill
           us, he would not have received a burnt offering and a meat
           offering at our hands, neither would he have shewed us all
           these things, nor would as at this time have told us such
           things as these.

07:013:024 And the woman bare a son, and called his name Samson: and the
           child grew, and the LORD blessed him.

07:013:025 And the Spirit of the LORD began to move him at times in the
           camp of Dan between Zorah and Eshtaol.

07:014:001 And Samson went down to Timnath, and saw a woman in Timnath of
           the daughters of the Philistines.

07:014:002 And he came up, and told his father and his mother, and said,
           I have seen a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the
           Philistines: now therefore get her for me to wife.

07:014:003 Then his father and his mother said unto him, Is there never a
           woman among the daughters of thy brethren, or among all my
           people, that thou goest to take a wife of the uncircumcised
           Philistines? And Samson said unto his father, Get her for me;
           for she pleaseth me well.

07:014:004 But his father and his mother knew not that it was of the
           LORD, that he sought an occasion against the Philistines: for
           at that time the Philistines had dominion over Israel.

07:014:005 Then went Samson down, and his father and his mother, to
           Timnath, and came to the vineyards of Timnath: and, behold, a
           young lion roared against him.

07:014:006 And the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and he rent
           him as he would have rent a kid, and he had nothing in his
           hand: but he told not his father or his mother what he had
           done.

07:014:007 And he went down, and talked with the woman; and she pleased
           Samson well.

07:014:008 And after a time he returned to take her, and he turned aside
           to see the carcase of the lion: and, behold, there was a swarm
           of bees and honey in the carcase of the lion.

07:014:009 And he took thereof in his hands, and went on eating, and came
           to his father and mother, and he gave them, and they did eat:
           but he told not them that he had taken the honey out of the
           carcase of the lion.

07:014:010 So his father went down unto the woman: and Samson made there
           a feast; for so used the young men to do.

07:014:011 And it came to pass, when they saw him, that they brought
           thirty companions to be with him.

07:014:012 And Samson said unto them, I will now put forth a riddle unto
           you: if ye can certainly declare it me within the seven days
           of the feast, and find it out, then I will give you thirty
           sheets and thirty change of garments:

07:014:013 But if ye cannot declare it me, then shall ye give me thirty
           sheets and thirty change of garments. And they said unto him,
           Put forth thy riddle, that we may hear it.

07:014:014 And he said unto them, Out of the eater came forth meat, and
           out of the strong came forth sweetness. And they could not in
           three days expound the riddle.

07:014:015 And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they said unto
           Samson's wife, Entice thy husband, that he may declare unto us
           the riddle, lest we burn thee and thy father's house with
           fire: have ye called us to take that we have? is it not so?

07:014:016 And Samson's wife wept before him, and said, Thou dost but
           hate me, and lovest me not: thou hast put forth a riddle unto
           the children of my people, and hast not told it me. And he
           said unto her, Behold, I have not told it my father nor my
           mother, and shall I tell it thee?

07:014:017 And she wept before him the seven days, while their feast
           lasted: and it came to pass on the seventh day, that he told
           her, because she lay sore upon him: and she told the riddle to
           the children of her people.

07:014:018 And the men of the city said unto him on the seventh day
           before the sun went down, What is sweeter than honey? And what
           is stronger than a lion? and he said unto them, If ye had not
           plowed with my heifer, ye had not found out my riddle.

07:014:019 And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he went down to
           Ashkelon, and slew thirty men of them, and took their spoil,
           and gave change of garments unto them which expounded the
           riddle. And his anger was kindled, and he went up to his
           father's house.

07:014:020 But Samson's wife was given to his companion, whom he had used
           as his friend.

07:015:001 But it came to pass within a while after, in the time of wheat
           harvest, that Samson visited his wife with a kid; and he said,
           I will go in to my wife into the chamber. But her father would
           not suffer him to go in.

07:015:002 And her father said, I verily thought that thou hadst utterly
           hated her; therefore I gave her to thy companion: is not her
           younger sister fairer than she? take her, I pray thee, instead
           of her.

07:015:003 And Samson said concerning them, Now shall I be more blameless
           than the Philistines, though I do them a displeasure.

07:015:004 And Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took
           firebrands, and turned tail to tail, and put a firebrand in
           the midst between two tails.

07:015:005 And when he had set the brands on fire, he let them go into
           the standing corn of the Philistines, and burnt up both the
           shocks, and also the standing corn, with the vineyards and
           olives.

07:015:006 Then the Philistines said, Who hath done this? And they
           answered, Samson, the son in law of the Timnite, because he
           had taken his wife, and given her to his companion. And the
           Philistines came up, and burnt her and her father with fire.

07:015:007 And Samson said unto them, Though ye have done this, yet will
           I be avenged of you, and after that I will cease.

07:015:008 And he smote them hip and thigh with a great slaughter: and he
           went down and dwelt in the top of the rock Etam.

07:015:009 Then the Philistines went up, and pitched in Judah, and spread
           themselves in Lehi.

07:015:010 And the men of Judah said, Why are ye come up against us? And
           they answered, To bind Samson are we come up, to do to him as
           he hath done to us.

07:015:011 Then three thousand men of Judah went to the top of the rock
           Etam, and said to Samson, Knowest thou not that the
           Philistines are rulers over us? what is this that thou hast
           done unto us? And he said unto them, As they did unto me, so
           have I done unto them.

07:015:012 And they said unto him, We are come down to bind thee, that we
           may deliver thee into the hand of the Philistines. And Samson
           said unto them, Swear unto me, that ye will not fall upon me
           yourselves.

07:015:013 And they spake unto him, saying, No; but we will bind thee
           fast, and deliver thee into their hand: but surely we will not
           kill thee. And they bound him with two new cords, and brought
           him up from the rock.

07:015:014 And when he came unto Lehi, the Philistines shouted against
           him: and the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and
           the cords that were upon his arms became as flax that was
           burnt with fire, and his bands loosed from off his hands.

07:015:015 And he found a new jawbone of an ass, and put forth his hand,
           and took it, and slew a thousand men therewith.

07:015:016 And Samson said, With the jawbone of an ass, heaps upon heaps,
           with the jaw of an ass have I slain a thousand men.

07:015:017 And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking, that
           he cast away the jawbone out of his hand, and called that
           place Ramathlehi.

07:015:018 And he was sore athirst, and called on the LORD, and said,
           Thou hast given this great deliverance into the hand of thy
           servant: and now shall I die for thirst, and fall into the
           hand of the uncircumcised?

07:015:019 But God clave an hollow place that was in the jaw, and there
           came water thereout; and when he had drunk, his spirit came
           again, and he revived: wherefore he called the name thereof
           Enhakkore, which is in Lehi unto this day.

07:015:020 And he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty
           years.

07:016:001 Then went Samson to Gaza, and saw there an harlot, and went in
           unto her.

07:016:002 And it was told the Gazites, saying, Samson is come hither.
           And they compassed him in, and laid wait for him all night in
           the gate of the city, and were quiet all the night, saying, In
           the morning, when it is day, we shall kill him.

07:016:003 And Samson lay till midnight, and arose at midnight, and took
           the doors of the gate of the city, and the two posts, and went
           away with them, bar and all, and put them upon his shoulders,
           and carried them up to the top of an hill that is before
           Hebron.

07:016:004 And it came to pass afterward, that he loved a woman in the
           valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah.

07:016:005 And the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and said
           unto her, Entice him, and see wherein his great strength
           lieth, and by what means we may prevail against him, that we
           may bind him to afflict him; and we will give thee every one
           of us eleven hundred pieces of silver.

07:016:006 And Delilah said to Samson, Tell me, I pray thee, wherein thy
           great strength lieth, and wherewith thou mightest be bound to
           afflict thee.

07:016:007 And Samson said unto her, If they bind me with seven green
           withs that were never dried, then shall I be weak, and be as
           another man.

07:016:008 Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven
           green withs which had not been dried, and she bound him with
           them.

07:016:009 Now there were men lying in wait, abiding with her in the
           chamber. And she said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee,
           Samson. And he brake the withs, as a thread of tow is broken
           when it toucheth the fire. So his strength was not known.

07:016:010 And Delilah said unto Samson, Behold, thou hast mocked me, and
           told me lies: now tell me, I pray thee, wherewith thou
           mightest be bound.

07:016:011 And he said unto her, If they bind me fast with new ropes that
           never were occupied, then shall I be weak, and be as another
           man.

07:016:012 Delilah therefore took new ropes, and bound him therewith, and
           said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And there
           were liers in wait abiding in the chamber. And he brake them
           from off his arms like a thread.

07:016:013 And Delilah said unto Samson, Hitherto thou hast mocked me,
           and told me lies: tell me wherewith thou mightest be bound.
           And he said unto her, If thou weavest the seven locks of my
           head with the web.

07:016:014 And she fastened it with the pin, and said unto him, The
           Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he awaked out of his
           sleep, and went away with the pin of the beam, and with the
           web.

07:016:015 And she said unto him, How canst thou say, I love thee, when
           thine heart is not with me? thou hast mocked me these three
           times, and hast not told me wherein thy great strength lieth.

07:016:016 And it came to pass, when she pressed him daily with her
           words, and urged him, so that his soul was vexed unto death;

07:016:017 That he told her all his heart, and said unto her, There hath
           not come a razor upon mine head; for I have been a Nazarite
           unto God from my mother's womb: if I be shaven, then my
           strength will go from me, and I shall become weak, and be like
           any other man.

07:016:018 And when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she
           sent and called for the lords of the Philistines, saying, Come
           up this once, for he hath shewed me all his heart. Then the
           lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and brought money
           in their hand.

07:016:019 And she made him sleep upon her knees; and she called for a
           man, and she caused him to shave off the seven locks of his
           head; and she began to afflict him, and his strength went from
           him.

07:016:020 And she said, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he
           awoke out of his sleep, and said, I will go out as at other
           times before, and shake myself. And he wist not that the LORD
           was departed from him.

07:016:021 But the Philistines took him, and put out his eyes, and
           brought him down to Gaza, and bound him with fetters of brass;
           and he did grind in the prison house.

07:016:022 Howbeit the hair of his head began to grow again after he was
           shaven.

07:016:023 Then the lords of the Philistines gathered them together for
           to offer a great sacrifice unto Dagon their god, and to
           rejoice: for they said, Our god hath delivered Samson our
           enemy into our hand.

07:016:024 And when the people saw him, they praised their god: for they
           said, Our god hath delivered into our hands our enemy, and the
           destroyer of our country, which slew many of us.

07:016:025 And it came to pass, when their hearts were merry, that they
           said, Call for Samson, that he may make us sport. And they
           called for Samson out of the prison house; and he made them
           sport: and they set him between the pillars.

07:016:026 And Samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand, Suffer
           me that I may feel the pillars whereupon the house standeth,
           that I may lean upon them.

07:016:027 Now the house was full of men and women; and all the lords of
           the Philistines were there; and there were upon the roof about
           three thousand men and women, that beheld while Samson made
           sport.

07:016:028 And Samson called unto the LORD, and said, O Lord God,
           remember me, I pray thee, and strengthen me, I pray thee, only
           this once, O God, that I may be at once avenged of the
           Philistines for my two eyes.

07:016:029 And Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the
           house stood, and on which it was borne up, of the one with his
           right hand, and of the other with his left.

07:016:030 And Samson said, Let me die with the Philistines. And he bowed
           himself with all his might; and the house fell upon the lords,
           and upon all the people that were therein. So the dead which
           he slew at his death were more than they which he slew in his
           life.

07:016:031 Then his brethren and all the house of his father came down,
           and took him, and brought him up, and buried him between Zorah
           and Eshtaol in the buryingplace of Manoah his father. And he
           judged Israel twenty years.

07:017:001 And there was a man of mount Ephraim, whose name was Micah.

07:017:002 And he said unto his mother, The eleven hundred shekels of
           silver that were taken from thee, about which thou cursedst,
           and spakest of also in mine ears, behold, the silver is with
           me; I took it. And his mother said, Blessed be thou of the
           LORD, my son.

07:017:003 And when he had restored the eleven hundred shekels of silver
           to his mother, his mother said, I had wholly dedicated the
           silver unto the LORD from my hand for my son, to make a graven
           image and a molten image: now therefore I will restore it unto
           thee.

07:017:004 Yet he restored the money unto his mother; and his mother took
           two hundred shekels of silver, and gave them to the founder,
           who made thereof a graven image and a molten image: and they
           were in the house of Micah.

07:017:005 And the man Micah had an house of gods, and made an ephod, and
           teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his
           priest.

07:017:006 In those days there was no king in Israel, but every man did
           that which was right in his own eyes.

07:017:007 And there was a young man out of Bethlehemjudah of the family
           of Judah, who was a Levite, and he sojourned there.

07:017:008 And the man departed out of the city from Bethlehemjudah to
           sojourn where he could find a place: and he came to mount
           Ephraim to the house of Micah, as he journeyed.

07:017:009 And Micah said unto him, Whence comest thou? And he said unto
           him, I am a Levite of Bethlehemjudah, and I go to sojourn
           where I may find a place.

07:017:010 And Micah said unto him, Dwell with me, and be unto me a
           father and a priest, and I will give thee ten shekels of
           silver by the year, and a suit of apparel, and thy victuals.
           So the Levite went in.

07:017:011 And the Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the
           young man was unto him as one of his sons.

07:017:012 And Micah consecrated the Levite; and the young man became his
           priest, and was in the house of Micah.

07:017:013 Then said Micah, Now know I that the LORD will do me good,
           seeing I have a Levite to my priest.

07:018:001 In those days there was no king in Israel: and in those days
           the tribe of the Danites sought them an inheritance to dwell
           in; for unto that day all their inheritance had not fallen
           unto them among the tribes of Israel.

07:018:002 And the children of Dan sent of their family five men from
           their coasts, men of valour, from Zorah, and from Eshtaol, to
           spy out the land, and to search it; and they said unto them,
           Go, search the land: who when they came to mount Ephraim, to
           the house of Micah, they lodged there.

07:018:003 When they were by the house of Micah, they knew the voice of
           the young man the Levite: and they turned in thither, and said
           unto him, Who brought thee hither? and what makest thou in
           this place? and what hast thou here?

07:018:004 And he said unto them, Thus and thus dealeth Micah with me,
           and hath hired me, and I am his priest.

07:018:005 And they said unto him, Ask counsel, we pray thee, of God,
           that we may know whether our way which we go shall be
           prosperous.

07:018:006 And the priest said unto them, Go in peace: before the LORD is
           your way wherein ye go.

07:018:007 Then the five men departed, and came to Laish, and saw the
           people that were therein, how they dwelt careless, after the
           manner of the Zidonians, quiet and secure; and there was no
           magistrate in the land, that might put them to shame in any
           thing; and they were far from the Zidonians, and had no
           business with any man.

07:018:008 And they came unto their brethren to Zorah and Eshtaol: and
           their brethren said unto them, What say ye?

07:018:009 And they said, Arise, that we may go up against them: for we
           have seen the land, and, behold, it is very good: and are ye
           still? be not slothful to go, and to enter to possess the
           land.

07:018:010 When ye go, ye shall come unto a people secure, and to a large
           land: for God hath given it into your hands; a place where
           there is no want of any thing that is in the earth.

07:018:011 And there went from thence of the family of the Danites, out
           of Zorah and out of Eshtaol, six hundred men appointed with
           weapons of war.

07:018:012 And they went up, and pitched in Kirjathjearim, in Judah:
           wherefore they called that place Mahanehdan unto this day:
           behold, it is behind Kirjathjearim.

07:018:013 And they passed thence unto mount Ephraim, and came unto the
           house of Micah.

07:018:014 Then answered the five men that went to spy out the country of
           Laish, and said unto their brethren, Do ye know that there is
           in these houses an ephod, and teraphim, and a graven image,
           and a molten image? now therefore consider what ye have to do.

07:018:015 And they turned thitherward, and came to the house of the
           young man the Levite, even unto the house of Micah, and
           saluted him.

07:018:016 And the six hundred men appointed with their weapons of war,
           which were of the children of Dan, stood by the entering of
           the gate.

07:018:017 And the five men that went to spy out the land went up, and
           came in thither, and took the graven image, and the ephod, and
           the teraphim, and the molten image: and the priest stood in
           the entering of the gate with the six hundred men that were
           appointed with weapons of war.

07:018:018 And these went into Micah's house, and fetched the carved
           image, the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image. Then
           said the priest unto them, What do ye?

07:018:019 And they said unto him, Hold thy peace, lay thine hand upon
           thy mouth, and go with us, and be to us a father and a priest:
           is it better for thee to be a priest unto the house of one
           man, or that thou be a priest unto a tribe and a family in
           Israel?

07:018:020 And the priest's heart was glad, and he took the ephod, and
           the teraphim, and the graven image, and went in the midst of
           the people.

07:018:021 So they turned and departed, and put the little ones and the
           cattle and the carriage before them.

07:018:022 And when they were a good way from the house of Micah, the men
           that were in the houses near to Micah's house were gathered
           together, and overtook the children of Dan.

07:018:023 And they cried unto the children of Dan. And they turned their
           faces, and said unto Micah, What aileth thee, that thou comest
           with such a company?

07:018:024 And he said, Ye have taken away my gods which I made, and the
           priest, and ye are gone away: and what have I more? and what
           is this that ye say unto me, What aileth thee?

07:018:025 And the children of Dan said unto him, Let not thy voice be
           heard among us, lest angry fellows run upon thee, and thou
           lose thy life, with the lives of thy household.

07:018:026 And the children of Dan went their way: and when Micah saw
           that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back
           unto his house.

07:018:027 And they took the things which Micah had made, and the priest
           which he had, and came unto Laish, unto a people that were at
           quiet and secure: and they smote them with the edge of the
           sword, and burnt the city with fire.

07:018:028 And there was no deliverer, because it was far from Zidon, and
           they had no business with any man; and it was in the valley
           that lieth by Bethrehob. And they built a city, and dwelt
           therein.

07:018:029 And they called the name of the city Dan, after the name of
           Dan their father, who was born unto Israel: howbeit the name
           of the city was Laish at the first.

07:018:030 And the children of Dan set up the graven image: and Jonathan,
           the son of Gershom, the son of Manasseh, he and his sons were
           priests to the tribe of Dan until the day of the captivity of
           the land.

07:018:031 And they set them up Micah's graven image, which he made, all
           the time that the house of God was in Shiloh.

07:019:001 And it came to pass in those days, when there was no king in
           Israel, that there was a certain Levite sojourning on the side
           of mount Ephraim, who took to him a concubine out of
           Bethlehemjudah.

07:019:002 And his concubine played the whore against him, and went away
           from him unto her father's house to Bethlehemjudah, and was
           there four whole months.

07:019:003 And her husband arose, and went after her, to speak friendly
           unto her, and to bring her again, having his servant with him,
           and a couple of asses: and she brought him into her father's
           house: and when the father of the damsel saw him, he rejoiced
           to meet him.

07:019:004 And his father in law, the damsel's father, retained him; and
           he abode with him three days: so they did eat and drink, and
           lodged there.

07:019:005 And it came to pass on the fourth day, when they arose early
           in the morning, that he rose up to depart: and the damsel's
           father said unto his son in law, Comfort thine heart with a
           morsel of bread, and afterward go your way.

07:019:006 And they sat down, and did eat and drink both of them
           together: for the damsel's father had said unto the man, Be
           content, I pray thee, and tarry all night, and let thine heart
           be merry.

07:019:007 And when the man rose up to depart, his father in law urged
           him: therefore he lodged there again.

07:019:008 And he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart;
           and the damsel's father said, Comfort thine heart, I pray
           thee. And they tarried until afternoon, and they did eat both
           of them.

07:019:009 And when the man rose up to depart, he, and his concubine, and
           his servant, his father in law, the damsel's father, said unto
           him, Behold, now the day draweth toward evening, I pray you
           tarry all night: behold, the day groweth to an end, lodge
           here, that thine heart may be merry; and to morrow get you
           early on your way, that thou mayest go home.

07:019:010 But the man would not tarry that night, but he rose up and
           departed, and came over against Jebus, which is Jerusalem; and
           there were with him two asses saddled, his concubine also was
           with him.

07:019:011 And when they were by Jebus, the day was far spent; and the
           servant said unto his master, Come, I pray thee, and let us
           turn in into this city of the Jebusites, and lodge in it.

07:019:012 And his master said unto him, We will not turn aside hither
           into the city of a stranger, that is not of the children of
           Israel; we will pass over to Gibeah.

07:019:013 And he said unto his servant, Come, and let us draw near to
           one of these places to lodge all night, in Gibeah, or in
           Ramah.

07:019:014 And they passed on and went their way; and the sun went down
           upon them when they were by Gibeah, which belongeth to
           Benjamin.

07:019:015 And they turned aside thither, to go in and to lodge in
           Gibeah: and when he went in, he sat him down in a street of
           the city: for there was no man that took them into his house
           to lodging.

07:019:016 And, behold, there came an old man from his work out of the
           field at even, which was also of mount Ephraim; and he
           sojourned in Gibeah: but the men of the place were Benjamites.

07:019:017 And when he had lifted up his eyes, he saw a wayfaring man in
           the street of the city: and the old man said, Whither goest
           thou? and whence comest thou?

07:019:018 And he said unto him, We are passing from Bethlehemjudah
           toward the side of mount Ephraim; from thence am I: and I went
           to Bethlehemjudah, but I am now going to the house of the
           LORD; and there is no man that receiveth me to house.

07:019:019 Yet there is both straw and provender for our asses; and there
           is bread and wine also for me, and for thy handmaid, and for
           the young man which is with thy servants: there is no want of
           any thing.

07:019:020 And the old man said, Peace be with thee; howsoever let all
           thy wants lie upon me; only lodge not in the street.

07:019:021 So he brought him into his house, and gave provender unto the
           asses: and they washed their feet, and did eat and drink.

07:019:022 Now as they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of
           the city, certain sons of Belial, beset the house round about,
           and beat at the door, and spake to the master of the house,
           the old man, saying, Bring forth the man that came into thine
           house, that we may know him.

07:019:023 And the man, the master of the house, went out unto them, and
           said unto them, Nay, my brethren, nay, I pray you, do not so
           wickedly; seeing that this man is come into mine house, do not
           this folly.

07:019:024 Behold, here is my daughter a maiden, and his concubine; them
           I will bring out now, and humble ye them, and do with them
           what seemeth good unto you: but unto this man do not so vile a
           thing.

07:019:025 But the men would not hearken to him: so the man took his
           concubine, and brought her forth unto them; and they knew her,
           and abused her all the night until the morning: and when the
           day began to spring, they let her go.

07:019:026 Then came the woman in the dawning of the day, and fell down
           at the door of the man's house where her lord was, till it was
           light.

07:019:027 And her lord rose up in the morning, and opened the doors of
           the house, and went out to go his way: and, behold, the woman
           his concubine was fallen down at the door of the house, and
           her hands were upon the threshold.

07:019:028 And he said unto her, Up, and let us be going. But none
           answered. Then the man took her up upon an ass, and the man
           rose up, and gat him unto his place.

07:019:029 And when he was come into his house, he took a knife, and laid
           hold on his concubine, and divided her, together with her
           bones, into twelve pieces, and sent her into all the coasts of
           Israel.

07:019:030 And it was so, that all that saw it said, There was no such
           deed done nor seen from the day that the children of Israel
           came up out of the land of Egypt unto this day: consider of
           it, take advice, and speak your minds.

07:020:001 Then all the children of Israel went out, and the congregation
           was gathered together as one man, from Dan even to Beersheba,
           with the land of Gilead, unto the LORD in Mizpeh.

07:020:002 And the chief of all the people, even of all the tribes of
           Israel, presented themselves in the assembly of the people of
           God, four hundred thousand footmen that drew sword.

07:020:003 (Now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of
           Israel were gone up to Mizpeh.) Then said the children of
           Israel, Tell us, how was this wickedness?

07:020:004 And the Levite, the husband of the woman that was slain,
           answered and said, I came into Gibeah that belongeth to
           Benjamin, I and my concubine, to lodge.

07:020:005 And the men of Gibeah rose against me, and beset the house
           round about upon me by night, and thought to have slain me:
           and my concubine have they forced, that she is dead.

07:020:006 And I took my concubine, and cut her in pieces, and sent her
           throughout all the country of the inheritance of Israel: for
           they have committed lewdness and folly in Israel.

07:020:007 Behold, ye are all children of Israel; give here your advice
           and counsel.

07:020:008 And all the people arose as one man, saying, We will not any
           of us go to his tent, neither will we any of us turn into his
           house.

07:020:009 But now this shall be the thing which we will do to Gibeah; we
           will go up by lot against it;

07:020:010 And we will take ten men of an hundred throughout all the
           tribes of Israel, and an hundred of a thousand, and a thousand
           out of ten thousand, to fetch victual for the people, that
           they may do, when they come to Gibeah of Benjamin, according
           to all the folly that they have wrought in Israel.

07:020:011 So all the men of Israel were gathered against the city, knit
           together as one man.

07:020:012 And the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of
           Benjamin, saying, What wickedness is this that is done among
           you?

07:020:013 Now therefore deliver us the men, the children of Belial,
           which are in Gibeah, that we may put them to death, and put
           away evil from Israel. But the children of Benjamin would not
           hearken to the voice of their brethren the children of Israel.

07:020:014 But the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together out
           of the cities unto Gibeah, to go out to battle against the
           children of Israel.

07:020:015 And the children of Benjamin were numbered at that time out of
           the cities twenty and six thousand men that drew sword, beside
           the inhabitants of Gibeah, which were numbered seven hundred
           chosen men.

07:020:016 Among all this people there were seven hundred chosen men
           lefthanded; every one could sling stones at an hair breadth,
           and not miss.

07:020:017 And the men of Israel, beside Benjamin, were numbered four
           hundred thousand men that drew sword: all these were men of
           war.

07:020:018 And the children of Israel arose, and went up to the house of
           God, and asked counsel of God, and said, Which of us shall go
           up first to the battle against the children of Benjamin? And
           the LORD said, Judah shall go up first.

07:020:019 And the children of Israel rose up in the morning, and
           encamped against Gibeah.

07:020:020 And the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin; and
           the men of Israel put themselves in array to fight against
           them at Gibeah.

07:020:021 And the children of Benjamin came forth out of Gibeah, and
           destroyed down to the ground of the Israelites that day twenty
           and two thousand men.

07:020:022 And the people the men of Israel encouraged themselves, and
           set their battle again in array in the place where they put
           themselves in array the first day.

07:020:023 (And the children of Israel went up and wept before the LORD
           until even, and asked counsel of the LORD, saying, Shall I go
           up again to battle against the children of Benjamin my
           brother? And the LORD said, Go up against him.)

07:020:024 And the children of Israel came near against the children of
           Benjamin the second day.

07:020:025 And Benjamin went forth against them out of Gibeah the second
           day, and destroyed down to the ground of the children of
           Israel again eighteen thousand men; all these drew the sword.

07:020:026 Then all the children of Israel, and all the people, went up,
           and came unto the house of God, and wept, and sat there before
           the LORD, and fasted that day until even, and offered burnt
           offerings and peace offerings before the LORD.

07:020:027 And the children of Israel enquired of the LORD, (for the ark
           of the covenant of God was there in those days,

07:020:028 And Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood
           before it in those days,) saying, Shall I yet again go out to
           battle against the children of Benjamin my brother, or shall I
           cease? And the LORD said, Go up; for to morrow I will deliver
           them into thine hand.

07:020:029 And Israel set liers in wait round about Gibeah.

07:020:030 And the children of Israel went up against the children of
           Benjamin on the third day, and put themselves in array against
           Gibeah, as at other times.

07:020:031 And the children of Benjamin went out against the people, and
           were drawn away from the city; and they began to smite of the
           people, and kill, as at other times, in the highways, of which
           one goeth up to the house of God, and the other to Gibeah in
           the field, about thirty men of Israel.

07:020:032 And the children of Benjamin said, They are smitten down
           before us, as at the first. But the children of Israel said,
           Let us flee, and draw them from the city unto the highways.

07:020:033 And all the men of Israel rose up out of their place, and put
           themselves in array at Baaltamar: and the liers in wait of
           Israel came forth out of their places, even out of the meadows
           of Gibeah.

07:020:034 And there came against Gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of
           all Israel, and the battle was sore: but they knew not that
           evil was near them.

07:020:035 And the LORD smote Benjamin before Israel: and the children of
           Israel destroyed of the Benjamites that day twenty and five
           thousand and an hundred men: all these drew the sword.

07:020:036 So the children of Benjamin saw that they were smitten: for
           the men of Israel gave place to the Benjamites, because they
           trusted unto the liers in wait which they had set beside
           Gibeah.

07:020:037 And the liers in wait hasted, and rushed upon Gibeah; and the
           liers in wait drew themselves along, and smote all the city
           with the edge of the sword.

07:020:038 Now there was an appointed sign between the men of Israel and
           the liers in wait, that they should make a great flame with
           smoke rise up out of the city.

07:020:039 And when the men of Israel retired in the battle, Benjamin
           began to smite and kill of the men of Israel about thirty
           persons: for they said, Surely they are smitten down before
           us, as in the first battle.

07:020:040 But when the flame began to arise up out of the city with a
           pillar of smoke, the Benjamites looked behind them, and,
           behold, the flame of the city ascended up to heaven.

07:020:041 And when the men of Israel turned again, the men of Benjamin
           were amazed: for they saw that evil was come upon them.

07:020:042 Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel
           unto the way of the wilderness; but the battle overtook them;
           and them which came out of the cities they destroyed in the
           midst of them.

07:020:043 Thus they inclosed the Benjamites round about, and chased
           them, and trode them down with ease over against Gibeah toward
           the sunrising.

07:020:044 And there fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men; all these
           were men of valour.

07:020:045 And they turned and fled toward the wilderness unto the rock
           of Rimmon: and they gleaned of them in the highways five
           thousand men; and pursued hard after them unto Gidom, and slew
           two thousand men of them.

07:020:046 So that all which fell that day of Benjamin were twenty and
           five thousand men that drew the sword; all these were men of
           valour.

07:020:047 But six hundred men turned and fled to the wilderness unto the
           rock Rimmon, and abode in the rock Rimmon four months.

07:020:048 And the men of Israel turned again upon the children of
           Benjamin, and smote them with the edge of the sword, as well
           the men of every city, as the beast, and all that came to
           hand: also they set on fire all the cities that they came to.

07:021:001 Now the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpeh, saying, There shall
           not any of us give his daughter unto Benjamin to wife.

07:021:002 And the people came to the house of God, and abode there till
           even before God, and lifted up their voices, and wept sore;

07:021:003 And said, O LORD God of Israel, why is this come to pass in
           Israel, that there should be to day one tribe lacking in
           Israel?

07:021:004 And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people rose early,
           and built there an altar, and offered burnt offerings and
           peace offerings.

07:021:005 And the children of Israel said, Who is there among all the
           tribes of Israel that came not up with the congregation unto
           the LORD? For they had made a great oath concerning him that
           came not up to the LORD to Mizpeh, saying, He shall surely be
           put to death.

07:021:006 And the children of Israel repented them for Benjamin their
           brother, and said, There is one tribe cut off from Israel this
           day.

07:021:007 How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing we have
           sworn by the LORD that we will not give them of our daughters
           to wives?

07:021:008 And they said, What one is there of the tribes of Israel that
           came not up to Mizpeh to the LORD? And, behold, there came
           none to the camp from Jabeshgilead to the assembly.

07:021:009 For the people were numbered, and, behold, there were none of
           the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead there.

07:021:010 And the congregation sent thither twelve thousand men of the
           valiantest, and commanded them, saying, Go and smite the
           inhabitants of Jabeshgilead with the edge of the sword, with
           the women and the children.

07:021:011 And this is the thing that ye shall do, Ye shall utterly
           destroy every male, and every woman that hath lain by man.

07:021:012 And they found among the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead four
           hundred young virgins, that had known no man by lying with any
           male: and they brought them unto the camp to Shiloh, which is
           in the land of Canaan.

07:021:013 And the whole congregation sent some to speak to the children
           of Benjamin that were in the rock Rimmon, and to call
           peaceably unto them.

07:021:014 And Benjamin came again at that time; and they gave them wives
           which they had saved alive of the women of Jabeshgilead: and
           yet so they sufficed them not.

07:021:015 And the people repented them for Benjamin, because that the
           LORD had made a breach in the tribes of Israel.

07:021:016 Then the elders of the congregation said, How shall we do for
           wives for them that remain, seeing the women are destroyed out
           of Benjamin?

07:021:017 And they said, There must be an inheritance for them that be
           escaped of Benjamin, that a tribe be not destroyed out of
           Israel.

07:021:018 Howbeit we may not give them wives of our daughters: for the
           children of Israel have sworn, saying, Cursed be he that
           giveth a wife to Benjamin.

07:021:019 Then they said, Behold, there is a feast of the LORD in Shiloh
           yearly in a place which is on the north side of Bethel, on the
           east side of the highway that goeth up from Bethel to Shechem,
           and on the south of Lebonah.

07:021:020 Therefore they commanded the children of Benjamin, saying, Go
           and lie in wait in the vineyards;

07:021:021 And see, and, behold, if the daughters of Shiloh come out to
           dance in dances, then come ye out of the vineyards, and catch
           you every man his wife of the daughters of Shiloh, and go to
           the land of Benjamin.

07:021:022 And it shall be, when their fathers or their brethren come
           unto us to complain, that we will say unto them, Be favourable
           unto them for our sakes: because we reserved not to each man
           his wife in the war: for ye did not give unto them at this
           time, that ye should be guilty.

07:021:023 And the children of Benjamin did so, and took them wives,
           according to their number, of them that danced, whom they
           caught: and they went and returned unto their inheritance, and
           repaired the cities, and dwelt in them.

07:021:024 And the children of Israel departed thence at that time, every
           man to his tribe and to his family, and they went out from
           thence every man to his inheritance.

07:021:025 In those days there was no king in Israel: every man did that
           which was right in his own eyes.

Book 08        Ruth

08:001:001 Now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled, that
           there was a famine in the land. And a certain man of
           Bethlehemjudah went to sojourn in the country of Moab, he, and
           his wife, and his two sons.

08:001:002 And the name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his
           wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion,
           Ephrathites of Bethlehemjudah. And they came into the country
           of Moab, and continued there.

08:001:003 And Elimelech Naomi's husband died; and she was left, and her
           two sons.

08:001:004 And they took them wives of the women of Moab; the name of the
           one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth: and they
           dwelled there about ten years.

08:001:005 And Mahlon and Chilion died also both of them; and the woman
           was left of her two sons and her husband.

08:001:006 Then she arose with her daughters in law, that she might
           return from the country of Moab: for she had heard in the
           country of Moab how that the LORD had visited his people in
           giving them bread.

08:001:007 Wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was, and
           her two daughters in law with her; and they went on the way to
           return unto the land of Judah.

08:001:008 And Naomi said unto her two daughters in law, Go, return each
           to her mother's house: the LORD deal kindly with you, as ye
           have dealt with the dead, and with me.

08:001:009 The LORD grant you that ye may find rest, each of you in the
           house of her husband. Then she kissed them; and they lifted up
           their voice, and wept.

08:001:010 And they said unto her, Surely we will return with thee unto
           thy people.

08:001:011 And Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters: why will ye go with
           me? are there yet any more sons in my womb, that they may be
           your husbands?

08:001:012 Turn again, my daughters, go your way; for I am too old to
           have an husband. If I should say, I have hope, if I should
           have an husband also to night, and should also bear sons;

08:001:013 Would ye tarry for them till they were grown? would ye stay
           for them from having husbands? nay, my daughters; for it
           grieveth me much for your sakes that the hand of the LORD is
           gone out against me.

08:001:014 And they lifted up their voice, and wept again: and Orpah
           kissed her mother in law; but Ruth clave unto her.

08:001:015 And she said, Behold, thy sister in law is gone back unto her
           people, and unto her gods: return thou after thy sister in
           law.

08:001:016 And Ruth said, Intreat me not to leave thee, or to return from
           following after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and
           where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people shall be my
           people, and thy God my God:

08:001:017 Where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried: the
           LORD do so to me, and more also, if ought but death part thee
           and me.

08:001:018 When she saw that she was stedfastly minded to go with her,
           then she left speaking unto her.

08:001:019 So they two went until they came to Bethlehem. And it came to
           pass, when they were come to Bethlehem, that all the city was
           moved about them, and they said, Is this Naomi?

08:001:020 And she said unto them, Call me not Naomi, call me Mara: for
           the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me.

08:001:021 I went out full and the LORD hath brought me home again empty:
           why then call ye me Naomi, seeing the LORD hath testified
           against me, and the Almighty hath afflicted me?

08:001:022 So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter in
           law, with her, which returned out of the country of Moab: and
           they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest.

08:002:001 And Naomi had a kinsman of her husband's, a mighty man of
           wealth, of the family of Elimelech; and his name was Boaz.

08:002:002 And Ruth the Moabitess said unto Naomi, Let me now go to the
           field, and glean ears of corn after him in whose sight I shall
           find grace. And she said unto her, Go, my daughter.

08:002:003 And she went, and came, and gleaned in the field after the
           reapers: and her hap was to light on a part of the field
           belonging unto Boaz, who was of the kindred of Elimelech.

08:002:004 And, behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said unto the
           reapers, The LORD be with you. And they answered him, The LORD
           bless thee.

08:002:005 Then said Boaz unto his servant that was set over the reapers,
           Whose damsel is this?

08:002:006 And the servant that was set over the reapers answered and
           said, It is the Moabitish damsel that came back with Naomi out
           of the country of Moab:

08:002:007 And she said, I pray you, let me glean and gather after the
           reapers among the sheaves: so she came, and hath continued
           even from the morning until now, that she tarried a little in
           the house.

08:002:008 Then said Boaz unto Ruth, Hearest thou not, my daughter? Go
           not to glean in another field, neither go from hence, but
           abide here fast by my maidens:

08:002:009 Let thine eyes be on the field that they do reap, and go thou
           after them: have I not charged the young men that they shall
           not touch thee? and when thou art athirst, go unto the
           vessels, and drink of that which the young men have drawn.

08:002:010 Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground,
           and said unto him, Why have I found grace in thine eyes, that
           thou shouldest take knowledge of me, seeing I am a stranger?

08:002:011 And Boaz answered and said unto her, It hath fully been shewed
           me, all that thou hast done unto thy mother in law since the
           death of thine husband: and how thou hast left thy father and
           thy mother, and the land of thy nativity, and art come unto a
           people which thou knewest not heretofore.

08:002:012 The LORD recompense thy work, and a full reward be given thee
           of the LORD God of Israel, under whose wings thou art come to
           trust.

08:002:013 Then she said, Let me find favour in thy sight, my lord; for
           that thou hast comforted me, and for that thou hast spoken
           friendly unto thine handmaid, though I be not like unto one of
           thine handmaidens.

08:002:014 And Boaz said unto her, At mealtime come thou hither, and eat
           of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar. And she sat
           beside the reapers: and he reached her parched corn, and she
           did eat, and was sufficed, and left.

08:002:015 And when she was risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young
           men, saying, Let her glean even among the sheaves, and
           reproach her not:

08:002:016 And let fall also some of the handfuls of purpose for her, and
           leave them, that she may glean them, and rebuke her not.

08:002:017 So she gleaned in the field until even, and beat out that she
           had gleaned: and it was about an ephah of barley.

08:002:018 And she took it up, and went into the city: and her mother in
           law saw what she had gleaned: and she brought forth, and gave
           to her that she had reserved after she was sufficed.

08:002:019 And her mother in law said unto her, Where hast thou gleaned
           to day? and where wroughtest thou? blessed be he that did take
           knowledge of thee. And she shewed her mother in law with whom
           she had wrought, and said, The man's name with whom I wrought
           to day is Boaz.

08:002:020 And Naomi said unto her daughter in law, Blessed be he of the
           LORD, who hath not left off his kindness to the living and to
           the dead. And Naomi said unto her, The man is near of kin unto
           us, one of our next kinsmen.

08:002:021 And Ruth the Moabitess said, He said unto me also, Thou shalt
           keep fast by my young men, until they have ended all my
           harvest.

08:002:022 And Naomi said unto Ruth her daughter in law, It is good, my
           daughter, that thou go out with his maidens, that they meet
           thee not in any other field.

08:002:023 So she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz to glean unto the end
           of barley harvest and of wheat harvest; and dwelt with her
           mother in law.

08:003:001 Then Naomi her mother in law said unto her, My daughter, shall
           I not seek rest for thee, that it may be well with thee?

08:003:002 And now is not Boaz of our kindred, with whose maidens thou
           wast? Behold, he winnoweth barley to night in the
           threshingfloor.

08:003:003 Wash thyself therefore, and anoint thee, and put thy raiment
           upon thee, and get thee down to the floor: but make not
           thyself known unto the man, until he shall have done eating
           and drinking.

08:003:004 And it shall be, when he lieth down, that thou shalt mark the
           place where he shall lie, and thou shalt go in, and uncover
           his feet, and lay thee down; and he will tell thee what thou
           shalt do.

08:003:005 And she said unto her, All that thou sayest unto me I will do.

08:003:006 And she went down unto the floor, and did according to all
           that her mother in law bade her.

08:003:007 And when Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he
           went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn: and she came
           softly, and uncovered his feet, and laid her down.

08:003:008 And it came to pass at midnight, that the man was afraid, and
           turned himself: and, behold, a woman lay at his feet.

08:003:009 And he said, Who art thou? And she answered, I am Ruth thine
           handmaid: spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid; for
           thou art a near kinsman.

08:003:010 And he said, Blessed be thou of the LORD, my daughter: for
           thou hast shewed more kindness in the latter end than at the
           beginning, inasmuch as thou followedst not young men, whether
           poor or rich.

08:003:011 And now, my daughter, fear not; I will do to thee all that
           thou requirest: for all the city of my people doth know that
           thou art a virtuous woman.

08:003:012 And now it is true that I am thy near kinsman: howbeit there
           is a kinsman nearer than I.

08:003:013 Tarry this night, and it shall be in the morning, that if he
           will perform unto thee the part of a kinsman, well; let him do
           the kinsman's part: but if he will not do the part of a
           kinsman to thee, then will I do the part of a kinsman to thee,
           as the LORD liveth: lie down until the morning.

08:003:014 And she lay at his feet until the morning: and she rose up
           before one could know another. And he said, Let it not be
           known that a woman came into the floor.

08:003:015 Also he said, Bring the vail that thou hast upon thee, and
           hold it. And when she held it, he measured six measures of
           barley, and laid it on her: and she went into the city.

08:003:016 And when she came to her mother in law, she said, Who art
           thou, my daughter? And she told her all that the man had done
           to her.

08:003:017 And she said, These six measures of barley gave he me; for he
           said to me, Go not empty unto thy mother in law.

08:003:018 Then said she, Sit still, my daughter, until thou know how the
           matter will fall: for the man will not be in rest, until he
           have finished the thing this day.

08:004:001 Then went Boaz up to the gate, and sat him down there: and,
           behold, the kinsman of whom Boaz spake came by; unto whom he
           said, Ho, such a one! turn aside, sit down here. And he turned
           aside, and sat down.

08:004:002 And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit
           ye down here. And they sat down.

08:004:003 And he said unto the kinsman, Naomi, that is come again out of
           the country of Moab, selleth a parcel of land, which was our
           brother Elimelech's:

08:004:004 And I thought to advertise thee, saying, Buy it before the
           inhabitants, and before the elders of my people. If thou wilt
           redeem it, redeem it: but if thou wilt not redeem it, then
           tell me, that I may know: for there is none to redeem it
           beside thee; and I am after thee. And he said, I will redeem
           it.

08:004:005 Then said Boaz, What day thou buyest the field of the hand of
           Naomi, thou must buy it also of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife
           of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead upon his
           inheritance.

08:004:006 And the kinsman said, I cannot redeem it for myself, lest I
           mar mine own inheritance: redeem thou my right to thyself; for
           I cannot redeem it.

08:004:007 Now this was the manner in former time in Israel concerning
           redeeming and concerning changing, for to confirm all things;
           a man plucked off his shoe, and gave it to his neighbour: and
           this was a testimony in Israel.

08:004:008 Therefore the kinsman said unto Boaz, Buy it for thee. So he
           drew off his shoe.

08:004:009 And Boaz said unto the elders, and unto all the people, Ye are
           witnesses this day, that I have bought all that was
           Elimelech's, and all that was Chilion's and Mahlon's, of the
           hand of Naomi.

08:004:010 Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I
           purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead upon
           his inheritance, that the name of the dead be not cut off from
           among his brethren, and from the gate of his place: ye are
           witnesses this day.

08:004:011 And all the people that were in the gate, and the elders,
           said, We are witnesses. The LORD make the woman that is come
           into thine house like Rachel and like Leah, which two did
           build the house of Israel: and do thou worthily in Ephratah,
           and be famous in Bethlehem:

08:004:012 And let thy house be like the house of Pharez, whom Tamar bare
           unto Judah, of the seed which the LORD shall give thee of this
           young woman.

08:004:013 So Boaz took Ruth, and she was his wife: and when he went in
           unto her, the LORD gave her conception, and she bare a son.

08:004:014 And the women said unto Naomi, Blessed be the LORD, which hath
           not left thee this day without a kinsman, that his name may be
           famous in Israel.

08:004:015 And he shall be unto thee a restorer of thy life, and a
           nourisher of thine old age: for thy daughter in law, which
           loveth thee, which is better to thee than seven sons, hath
           born him.

08:004:016 And Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became
           nurse unto it.

08:004:017 And the women her neighbours gave it a name, saying, There is
           a son born to Naomi; and they called his name Obed: he is the
           father of Jesse, the father of David.

08:004:018 Now these are the generations of Pharez: Pharez begat Hezron,

08:004:019 And Hezron begat Ram, and Ram begat Amminadab,

08:004:020 And Amminadab begat Nahshon, and Nahshon begat Salmon,

08:004:021 And Salmon begat Boaz, and Boaz begat Obed,

08:004:022 And Obed begat Jesse, and Jesse begat David.

Book 09        1 Samuel

09:001:001 Now there was a certain man of Ramathaimzophim, of mount
           Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son
           of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite:

09:001:002 And he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the
           name of the other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but
           Hannah had no children.

09:001:003 And this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to
           sacrifice unto the LORD of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons
           of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the LORD, were
           there.

09:001:004 And when the time was that Elkanah offered, he gave to
           Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters,
           portions:

09:001:005 But unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion; for he loved Hannah:
           but the LORD had shut up her womb.

09:001:006 And her adversary also provoked her sore, for to make her
           fret, because the LORD had shut up her womb.

09:001:007 And as he did so year by year, when she went up to the house
           of the LORD, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did
           not eat.

09:001:008 Then said Elkanah her husband to her, Hannah, why weepest
           thou? and why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved?
           am not I better to thee than ten sons?

09:001:009 So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after
           they had drunk. Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post
           of the temple of the LORD.

09:001:010 And she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto the LORD,
           and wept sore.

09:001:011 And she vowed a vow, and said, O LORD of hosts, if thou wilt
           indeed look on the affliction of thine handmaid, and remember
           me, and not forget thine handmaid, but wilt give unto thine
           handmaid a man child, then I will give him unto the LORD all
           the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his
           head.

09:001:012 And it came to pass, as she continued praying before the LORD,
           that Eli marked her mouth.

09:001:013 Now Hannah, she spake in her heart; only her lips moved, but
           her voice was not heard: therefore Eli thought she had been
           drunken.

09:001:014 And Eli said unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away
           thy wine from thee.

09:001:015 And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a
           sorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink,
           but have poured out my soul before the LORD.

09:001:016 Count not thine handmaid for a daughter of Belial: for out of
           the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken
           hitherto.

09:001:017 Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace: and the God of Israel
           grant thee thy petition that thou hast asked of him.

09:001:018 And she said, Let thine handmaid find grace in thy sight. So
           the woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was
           no more sad.

09:001:019 And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before
           the LORD, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and
           Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the LORD remembered her.

09:001:020 Wherefore it came to pass, when the time was come about after
           Hannah had conceived, that she bare a son, and called his name
           Samuel, saying, Because I have asked him of the LORD.

09:001:021 And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer unto
           the LORD the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.

09:001:022 But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband, I will
           not go up until the child be weaned, and then I will bring
           him, that he may appear before the LORD, and there abide for
           ever.

09:001:023 And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Do what seemeth thee
           good; tarry until thou have weaned him; only the LORD
           establish his word. So the woman abode, and gave her son suck
           until she weaned him.

09:001:024 And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with
           three bullocks, and one ephah of flour, and a bottle of wine,
           and brought him unto the house of the LORD in Shiloh: and the
           child was young.

09:001:025 And they slew a bullock, and brought the child to Eli.

09:001:026 And she said, Oh my lord, as thy soul liveth, my lord, I am
           the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto the LORD.

09:001:027 For this child I prayed; and the LORD hath given me my
           petition which I asked of him:

09:001:028 Therefore also I have lent him to the LORD; as long as he
           liveth he shall be lent to the LORD. And he worshipped the
           LORD there.

09:002:001 And Hannah prayed, and said, My heart rejoiceth in the LORD,
           mine horn is exalted in the LORD: my mouth is enlarged over
           mine enemies; because I rejoice in thy salvation.

09:002:002 There is none holy as the LORD: for there is none beside thee:
           neither is there any rock like our God.

09:002:003 Talk no more so exceeding proudly; let not arrogancy come out
           of your mouth: for the LORD is a God of knowledge, and by him
           actions are weighed.

09:002:004 The bows of the mighty men are broken, and they that stumbled
           are girded with strength.

09:002:005 They that were full have hired out themselves for bread; and
           they that were hungry ceased: so that the barren hath born
           seven; and she that hath many children is waxed feeble.

09:002:006 The LORD killeth, and maketh alive: he bringeth down to the
           grave, and bringeth up.

09:002:007 The LORD maketh poor, and maketh rich: he bringeth low, and
           lifteth up.

09:002:008 He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth up the
           beggar from the dunghill, to set them among princes, and to
           make them inherit the throne of glory: for the pillars of the
           earth are the LORD's, and he hath set the world upon them.

09:002:009 He will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall be
           silent in darkness; for by strength shall no man prevail.

09:002:010 The adversaries of the LORD shall be broken to pieces; out of
           heaven shall he thunder upon them: the LORD shall judge the
           ends of the earth; and he shall give strength unto his king,
           and exalt the horn of his anointed.

09:002:011 And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the child did
           minister unto the LORD before Eli the priest.

09:002:012 Now the sons of Eli were sons of Belial; they knew not the
           LORD.

09:002:013 And the priest's custom with the people was, that, when any
           man offered sacrifice, the priest's servant came, while the
           flesh was in seething, with a fleshhook of three teeth in his
           hand;

09:002:014 And he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot;
           all that the fleshhook brought up the priest took for himself.
           So they did in Shiloh unto all the Israelites that came
           thither.

09:002:015 Also before they burnt the fat, the priest's servant came, and
           said to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the
           priest; for he will not have sodden flesh of thee, but raw.

09:002:016 And if any man said unto him, Let them not fail to burn the
           fat presently, and then take as much as thy soul desireth;
           then he would answer him, Nay; but thou shalt give it me now:
           and if not, I will take it by force.

09:002:017 Wherefore the sin of the young men was very great before the
           LORD: for men abhorred the offering of the LORD.

09:002:018 But Samuel ministered before the LORD, being a child, girded
           with a linen ephod.

09:002:019 Moreover his mother made him a little coat, and brought it to
           him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to
           offer the yearly sacrifice.

09:002:020 And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, The LORD give
           thee seed of this woman for the loan which is lent to the
           LORD. And they went unto their own home.

09:002:021 And the LORD visited Hannah, so that she conceived, and bare
           three sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before
           the LORD.

09:002:022 Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did unto all
           Israel; and how they lay with the women that assembled at the
           door of the tabernacle of the congregation.

09:002:023 And he said unto them, Why do ye such things? for I hear of
           your evil dealings by all this people.

09:002:024 Nay, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear: ye make
           the LORD's people to transgress.

09:002:025 If one man sin against another, the judge shall judge him: but
           if a man sin against the LORD, who shall intreat for him?
           Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto the voice of their
           father, because the LORD would slay them.

09:002:026 And the child Samuel grew on, and was in favour both with the
           LORD, and also with men.

09:002:027 And there came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him, Thus
           saith the LORD, Did I plainly appear unto the house of thy
           father, when they were in Egypt in Pharaoh's house?

09:002:028 And did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my
           priest, to offer upon mine altar, to burn incense, to wear an
           ephod before me? and did I give unto the house of thy father
           all the offerings made by fire of the children of Israel?

09:002:029 Wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at mine offering, which
           I have commanded in my habitation; and honourest thy sons
           above me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the
           offerings of Israel my people?

09:002:030 Wherefore the LORD God of Israel saith, I said indeed that thy
           house, and the house of thy father, should walk before me for
           ever: but now the LORD saith, Be it far from me; for them that
           honour me I will honour, and they that despise me shall be
           lightly esteemed.

09:002:031 Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the
           arm of thy father's house, that there shall not be an old man
           in thine house.

09:002:032 And thou shalt see an enemy in my habitation, in all the
           wealth which God shall give Israel: and there shall not be an
           old man in thine house for ever.

09:002:033 And the man of thine, whom I shall not cut off from mine
           altar, shall be to consume thine eyes, and to grieve thine
           heart: and all the increase of thine house shall die in the
           flower of their age.

09:002:034 And this shall be a sign unto thee, that shall come upon thy
           two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas; in one day they shall die
           both of them.

09:002:035 And I will raise me up a faithful priest, that shall do
           according to that which is in mine heart and in my mind: and I
           will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before mine
           anointed for ever.

09:002:036 And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left in
           thine house shall come and crouch to him for a piece of silver
           and a morsel of bread, and shall say, Put me, I pray thee,
           into one of the priests' offices, that I may eat a piece of
           bread.

09:003:001 And the child Samuel ministered unto the LORD before Eli. And
           the word of the LORD was precious in those days; there was no
           open vision.

09:003:002 And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in
           his place, and his eyes began to wax dim, that he could not
           see;

09:003:003 And ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the LORD,
           where the ark of God was, and Samuel was laid down to sleep;

09:003:004 That the LORD called Samuel: and he answered, Here am I.

09:003:005 And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst
           me. And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and
           lay down.

09:003:006 And the LORD called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and
           went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And
           he answered, I called not, my son; lie down again.

09:003:007 Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, neither was the word of
           the LORD yet revealed unto him.

09:003:008 And the LORD called Samuel again the third time. And he arose
           and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me.
           And Eli perceived that the LORD had called the child.

09:003:009 Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be,
           if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, LORD; for thy
           servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place.

09:003:010 And the LORD came, and stood, and called as at other times,
           Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel answered, Speak; for thy servant
           heareth.

09:003:011 And the LORD said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in
           Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it
           shall tingle.

09:003:012 In that day I will perform against Eli all things which I have
           spoken concerning his house: when I begin, I will also make an
           end.

09:003:013 For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever for
           the iniquity which he knoweth; because his sons made
           themselves vile, and he restrained them not.

09:003:014 And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the
           iniquity of Eli's house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor
           offering for ever.

09:003:015 And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the
           house of the LORD. And Samuel feared to shew Eli the vision.

09:003:016 Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he
           answered, Here am I.

09:003:017 And he said, What is the thing that the LORD hath said unto
           thee? I pray thee hide it not from me: God do so to thee, and
           more also, if thou hide any thing from me of all the things
           that he said unto thee.

09:003:018 And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And
           he said, It is the LORD: let him do what seemeth him good.

09:003:019 And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him, and did let none
           of his words fall to the ground.

09:003:020 And all Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel was
           established to be a prophet of the LORD.

09:003:021 And the LORD appeared again in Shiloh: for the LORD revealed
           himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the LORD.

09:004:001 And the word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went out
           against the Philistines to battle, and pitched beside
           Ebenezer: and the Philistines pitched in Aphek.

09:004:002 And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel:
           and when they joined battle, Israel was smitten before the
           Philistines: and they slew of the army in the field about four
           thousand men.

09:004:003 And when the people were come into the camp, the elders of
           Israel said, Wherefore hath the LORD smitten us to day before
           the Philistines? Let us fetch the ark of the covenant of the
           LORD out of Shiloh unto us, that, when it cometh among us, it
           may save us out of the hand of our enemies.

09:004:004 So the people sent to Shiloh, that they might bring from
           thence the ark of the covenant of the LORD of hosts, which
           dwelleth between the cherubims: and the two sons of Eli,
           Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant
           of God.

09:004:005 And when the ark of the covenant of the LORD came into the
           camp, all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth
           rang again.

09:004:006 And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they
           said, What meaneth the noise of this great shout in the camp
           of the Hebrews? And they understood that the ark of the LORD
           was come into the camp.

09:004:007 And the Philistines were afraid, for they said, God is come
           into the camp. And they said, Woe unto us! for there hath not
           been such a thing heretofore.

09:004:008 Woe unto us! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these
           mighty Gods? these are the Gods that smote the Egyptians with
           all the plagues in the wilderness.

09:004:009 Be strong and quit yourselves like men, O ye Philistines, that
           ye be not servants unto the Hebrews, as they have been to you:
           quit yourselves like men, and fight.

09:004:010 And the Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten, and they
           fled every man into his tent: and there was a very great
           slaughter; for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen.

09:004:011 And the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni
           and Phinehas, were slain.

09:004:012 And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to
           Shiloh the same day with his clothes rent, and with earth upon
           his head.

09:004:013 And when he came, lo, Eli sat upon a seat by the wayside
           watching: for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And when
           the man came into the city, and told it, all the city cried
           out.

09:004:014 And when Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, What
           meaneth the noise of this tumult? And the man came in hastily,
           and told Eli.

09:004:015 Now Eli was ninety and eight years old; and his eyes were dim,
           that he could not see.

09:004:016 And the man said unto Eli, I am he that came out of the army,
           and I fled to day out of the army. And he said, What is there
           done, my son?

09:004:017 And the messenger answered and said, Israel is fled before the
           Philistines, and there hath been also a great slaughter among
           the people, and thy two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are
           dead, and the ark of God is taken.

09:004:018 And it came to pass, when he made mention of the ark of God,
           that he fell from off the seat backward by the side of the
           gate, and his neck brake, and he died: for he was an old man,
           and heavy. And he had judged Israel forty years.

09:004:019 And his daughter in law, Phinehas' wife, was with child, near
           to be delivered: and when she heard the tidings that the ark
           of God was taken, and that her father in law and her husband
           were dead, she bowed herself and travailed; for her pains came
           upon her.

09:004:020 And about the time of her death the women that stood by her
           said unto her, Fear not; for thou hast born a son. But she
           answered not, neither did she regard it.

09:004:021 And she named the child Ichabod, saying, The glory is departed
           from Israel: because the ark of God was taken, and because of
           her father in law and her husband.

09:004:022 And she said, The glory is departed from Israel: for the ark
           of God is taken.

09:005:001 And the Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it from
           Ebenezer unto Ashdod.

09:005:002 When the Philistines took the ark of God, they brought it into
           the house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon.

09:005:003 And when they of Ashdod arose early on the morrow, behold,
           Dagon was fallen upon his face to the earth before the ark of
           the LORD. And they took Dagon, and set him in his place again.

09:005:004 And when they arose early on the morrow morning, behold, Dagon
           was fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of the
           LORD; and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands
           were cut off upon the threshold; only the stump of Dagon was
           left to him.

09:005:005 Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any that come into
           Dagon's house, tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod unto
           this day.

09:005:006 But the hand of the LORD was heavy upon them of Ashdod, and he
           destroyed them, and smote them with emerods, even Ashdod and
           the coasts thereof.

09:005:007 And when the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said, The
           ark of the God of Israel shall not abide with us: for his hand
           is sore upon us, and upon Dagon our god.

09:005:008 They sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the
           Philistines unto them, and said, What shall we do with the ark
           of the God of Israel? And they answered, Let the ark of the
           God of Israel be carried about unto Gath. And they carried the
           ark of the God of Israel about thither.

09:005:009 And it was so, that, after they had carried it about, the hand
           of the LORD was against the city with a very great
           destruction: and he smote the men of the city, both small and
           great, and they had emerods in their secret parts.

09:005:010 Therefore they sent the ark of God to Ekron. And it came to
           pass, as the ark of God came to Ekron, that the Ekronites
           cried out, saying, They have brought about the ark of the God
           of Israel to us, to slay us and our people.

09:005:011 So they sent and gathered together all the lords of the
           Philistines, and said, Send away the ark of the God of Israel,
           and let it go again to his own place, that it slay us not, and
           our people: for there was a deadly destruction throughout all
           the city; the hand of God was very heavy there.

09:005:012 And the men that died not were smitten with the emerods: and
           the cry of the city went up to heaven.

09:006:001 And the ark of the LORD was in the country of the Philistines
           seven months.

09:006:002 And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners,
           saying, What shall we do to the ark of the LORD? tell us
           wherewith we shall send it to his place.

09:006:003 And they said, If ye send away the ark of the God of Israel,
           send it not empty; but in any wise return him a trespass
           offering: then ye shall be healed, and it shall be known to
           you why his hand is not removed from you.

09:006:004 Then said they, What shall be the trespass offering which we
           shall return to him? They answered, Five golden emerods, and
           five golden mice, according to the number of the lords of the
           Philistines: for one plague was on you all, and on your lords.

09:006:005 Wherefore ye shall make images of your emerods, and images of
           your mice that mar the land; and ye shall give glory unto the
           God of Israel: peradventure he will lighten his hand from off
           you, and from off your gods, and from off your land.

09:006:006 Wherefore then do ye harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and
           Pharaoh hardened their hearts? when he had wrought wonderfully
           among them, did they not let the people go, and they departed?

09:006:007 Now therefore make a new cart, and take two milch kine, on
           which there hath come no yoke, and tie the kine to the cart,
           and bring their calves home from them:

09:006:008 And take the ark of the LORD, and lay it upon the cart; and
           put the jewels of gold, which ye return him for a trespass
           offering, in a coffer by the side thereof; and send it away,
           that it may go.

09:006:009 And see, if it goeth up by the way of his own coast to
           Bethshemesh, then he hath done us this great evil: but if not,
           then we shall know that it is not his hand that smote us: it
           was a chance that happened to us.

09:006:010 And the men did so; and took two milch kine, and tied them to
           the cart, and shut up their calves at home:

09:006:011 And they laid the ark of the LORD upon the cart, and the
           coffer with the mice of gold and the images of their emerods.

09:006:012 And the kine took the straight way to the way of Bethshemesh,
           and went along the highway, lowing as they went, and turned
           not aside to the right hand or to the left; and the lords of
           the Philistines went after them unto the border of
           Bethshemesh.

09:006:013 And they of Bethshemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in
           the valley: and they lifted up their eyes, and saw the ark,
           and rejoiced to see it.

09:006:014 And the cart came into the field of Joshua, a Bethshemite, and
           stood there, where there was a great stone: and they clave the
           wood of the cart, and offered the kine a burnt offering unto
           the LORD.

09:006:015 And the Levites took down the ark of the LORD, and the coffer
           that was with it, wherein the jewels of gold were, and put
           them on the great stone: and the men of Bethshemesh offered
           burnt offerings and sacrificed sacrifices the same day unto
           the LORD.

09:006:016 And when the five lords of the Philistines had seen it, they
           returned to Ekron the same day.

09:006:017 And these are the golden emerods which the Philistines
           returned for a trespass offering unto the LORD; for Ashdod
           one, for Gaza one, for Askelon one, for Gath one, for Ekron
           one;

09:006:018 And the golden mice, according to the number of all the cities
           of the Philistines belonging to the five lords, both of fenced
           cities, and of country villages, even unto the great stone of
           Abel, whereon they set down the ark of the LORD: which stone
           remaineth unto this day in the field of Joshua, the
           Bethshemite.

09:006:019 And he smote the men of Bethshemesh, because they had looked
           into the ark of the LORD, even he smote of the people fifty
           thousand and threescore and ten men: and the people lamented,
           because the LORD had smitten many of the people with a great
           slaughter.

09:006:020 And the men of Bethshemesh said, Who is able to stand before
           this holy LORD God? and to whom shall he go up from us?

09:006:021 And they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kirjathjearim,
           saying, The Philistines have brought again the ark of the
           LORD; come ye down, and fetch it up to you.

09:007:001 And the men of Kirjathjearim came, and fetched up the ark of
           the LORD, and brought it into the house of Abinadab in the
           hill, and sanctified Eleazar his son to keep the ark of the
           LORD.

09:007:002 And it came to pass, while the ark abode in Kirjathjearim,
           that the time was long; for it was twenty years: and all the
           house of Israel lamented after the LORD.

09:007:003 And Samuel spake unto all the house of Israel, saying, If ye
           do return unto the LORD with all your hearts, then put away
           the strange gods and Ashtaroth from among you, and prepare
           your hearts unto the LORD, and serve him only: and he will
           deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines.

09:007:004 Then the children of Israel did put away Baalim and Ashtaroth,
           and served the LORD only.

09:007:005 And Samuel said, Gather all Israel to Mizpeh, and I will pray
           for you unto the LORD.

09:007:006 And they gathered together to Mizpeh, and drew water, and
           poured it out before the LORD, and fasted on that day, and
           said there, We have sinned against the LORD. And Samuel judged
           the children of Israel in Mizpeh.

09:007:007 And when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel
           were gathered together to Mizpeh, the lords of the Philistines
           went up against Israel. And when the children of Israel heard
           it, they were afraid of the Philistines.

09:007:008 And the children of Israel said to Samuel, Cease not to cry
           unto the LORD our God for us, that he will save us out of the
           hand of the Philistines.

09:007:009 And Samuel took a sucking lamb, and offered it for a burnt
           offering wholly unto the LORD: and Samuel cried unto the LORD
           for Israel; and the LORD heard him.

09:007:010 And as Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the
           Philistines drew near to battle against Israel: but the LORD
           thundered with a great thunder on that day upon the
           Philistines, and discomfited them; and they were smitten
           before Israel.

09:007:011 And the men of Israel went out of Mizpeh, and pursued the
           Philistines, and smote them, until they came under Bethcar.

09:007:012 Then Samuel took a stone, and set it between Mizpeh and Shen,
           and called the name of it Ebenezer, saying, Hitherto hath the
           LORD helped us.

09:007:013 So the Philistines were subdued, and they came no more into
           the coast of Israel: and the hand of the LORD was against the
           Philistines all the days of Samuel.

09:007:014 And the cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel
           were restored to Israel, from Ekron even unto Gath; and the
           coasts thereof did Israel deliver out of the hands of the
           Philistines. And there was peace between Israel and the
           Amorites.

09:007:015 And Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.

09:007:016 And he went from year to year in circuit to Bethel, and
           Gilgal, and Mizpeh, and judged Israel in all those places.

09:007:017 And his return was to Ramah; for there was his house; and
           there he judged Israel; and there he built an altar unto the
           LORD.

09:008:001 And it came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he made his
           sons judges over Israel.

09:008:002 Now the name of his firstborn was Joel; and the name of his
           second, Abiah: they were judges in Beersheba.

09:008:003 And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after
           lucre, and took bribes, and perverted judgment.

09:008:004 Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together,
           and came to Samuel unto Ramah,

09:008:005 And said unto him, Behold, thou art old, and thy sons walk not
           in thy ways: now make us a king to judge us like all the
           nations.

09:008:006 But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us a
           king to judge us. And Samuel prayed unto the LORD.

09:008:007 And the LORD said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the
           people in all that they say unto thee: for they have not
           rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not
           reign over them.

09:008:008 According to all the works which they have done since the day
           that I brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day,
           wherewith they have forsaken me, and served other gods, so do
           they also unto thee.

09:008:009 Now therefore hearken unto their voice: howbeit yet protest
           solemnly unto them, and shew them the manner of the king that
           shall reign over them.

09:008:010 And Samuel told all the words of the LORD unto the people that
           asked of him a king.

09:008:011 And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall
           reign over you: He will take your sons, and appoint them for
           himself, for his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and some
           shall run before his chariots.

09:008:012 And he will appoint him captains over thousands, and captains
           over fifties; and will set them to ear his ground, and to reap
           his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and
           instruments of his chariots.

09:008:013 And he will take your daughters to be confectionaries, and to
           be cooks, and to be bakers.

09:008:014 And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your
           oliveyards, even the best of them, and give them to his
           servants.

09:008:015 And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your
           vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his servants.

09:008:016 And he will take your menservants, and your maidservants, and
           your goodliest young men, and your asses, and put them to his
           work.

09:008:017 He will take the tenth of your sheep: and ye shall be his
           servants.

09:008:018 And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye
           shall have chosen you; and the LORD will not hear you in that
           day.

09:008:019 Nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel;
           and they said, Nay; but we will have a king over us;

09:008:020 That we also may be like all the nations; and that our king
           may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles.

09:008:021 And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed
           them in the ears of the LORD.

09:008:022 And the LORD said to Samuel, Hearken unto their voice, and
           make them a king. And Samuel said unto the men of Israel, Go
           ye every man unto his city.

09:009:001 Now there was a man of Benjamin, whose name was Kish, the son
           of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Bechorath, the son of
           Aphiah, a Benjamite, a mighty man of power.

09:009:002 And he had a son, whose name was Saul, a choice young man, and
           a goodly: and there was not among the children of Israel a
           goodlier person than he: from his shoulders and upward he was
           higher than any of the people.

09:009:003 And the asses of Kish Saul's father were lost. And Kish said
           to Saul his son, Take now one of the servants with thee, and
           arise, go seek the asses.

09:009:004 And he passed through mount Ephraim, and passed through the
           land of Shalisha, but they found them not: then they passed
           through the land of Shalim, and there they were not: and he
           passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they found them
           not.

09:009:005 And when they were come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his
           servant that was with him, Come, and let us return; lest my
           father leave caring for the asses, and take thought for us.

09:009:006 And he said unto him, Behold now, there is in this city a man
           of God, and he is an honourable man; all that he saith cometh
           surely to pass: now let us go thither; peradventure he can
           shew us our way that we should go.

09:009:007 Then said Saul to his servant, But, behold, if we go, what
           shall we bring the man? for the bread is spent in our vessels,
           and there is not a present to bring to the man of God: what
           have we?

09:009:008 And the servant answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have
           here at hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver: that will
           I give to the man of God, to tell us our way.

09:009:009 (Beforetime in Israel, when a man went to enquire of God, thus
           he spake, Come, and let us go to the seer: for he that is now
           called a Prophet was beforetime called a Seer.)

09:009:010 Then said Saul to his servant, Well said; come, let us go. So
           they went unto the city where the man of God was.

09:009:011 And as they went up the hill to the city, they found young
           maidens going out to draw water, and said unto them, Is the
           seer here?

09:009:012 And they answered them, and said, He is; behold, he is before
           you: make haste now, for he came to day to the city; for there
           is a sacrifice of the people to day in the high place:

09:009:013 As soon as ye be come into the city, ye shall straightway find
           him, before he go up to the high place to eat: for the people
           will not eat until he come, because he doth bless the
           sacrifice; and afterwards they eat that be bidden. Now
           therefore get you up; for about this time ye shall find him.

09:009:014 And they went up into the city: and when they were come into
           the city, behold, Samuel came out against them, for to go up
           to the high place.

09:009:015 Now the LORD had told Samuel in his ear a day before Saul
           came, saying,

09:009:016 To morrow about this time I will send thee a man out of the
           land of Benjamin, and thou shalt anoint him to be captain over
           my people Israel, that he may save my people out of the hand
           of the Philistines: for I have looked upon my people, because
           their cry is come unto me.

09:009:017 And when Samuel saw Saul, the LORD said unto him, Behold the
           man whom I spake to thee of! this same shall reign over my
           people.

09:009:018 Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, Tell me,
           I pray thee, where the seer's house is.

09:009:019 And Samuel answered Saul, and said, I am the seer: go up
           before me unto the high place; for ye shall eat with me to
           day, and to morrow I will let thee go, and will tell thee all
           that is in thine heart.

09:009:020 And as for thine asses that were lost three days ago, set not
           thy mind on them; for they are found. And on whom is all the
           desire of Israel? Is it not on thee, and on all thy father's
           house?

09:009:021 And Saul answered and said, Am not I a Benjamite, of the
           smallest of the tribes of Israel? and my family the least of
           all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? wherefore then
           speakest thou so to me?

09:009:022 And Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into
           the parlour, and made them sit in the chiefest place among
           them that were bidden, which were about thirty persons.

09:009:023 And Samuel said unto the cook, Bring the portion which I gave
           thee, of which I said unto thee, Set it by thee.

09:009:024 And the cook took up the shoulder, and that which was upon it,
           and set it before Saul. And Samuel said, Behold that which is
           left! set it before thee, and eat: for unto this time hath it
           been kept for thee since I said, I have invited the people. So
           Saul did eat with Samuel that day.

09:009:025 And when they were come down from the high place into the
           city, Samuel communed with Saul upon the top of the house.

09:009:026 And they arose early: and it came to pass about the spring of
           the day, that Samuel called Saul to the top of the house,
           saying, Up, that I may send thee away. And Saul arose, and
           they went out both of them, he and Samuel, abroad.

09:009:027 And as they were going down to the end of the city, Samuel
           said to Saul, Bid the servant pass on before us, (and he
           passed on), but stand thou still a while, that I may shew thee
           the word of God.

09:010:001 Then Samuel took a vial of oil, and poured it upon his head,
           and kissed him, and said, Is it not because the LORD hath
           anointed thee to be captain over his inheritance?

09:010:002 When thou art departed from me to day, then thou shalt find
           two men by Rachel's sepulchre in the border of Benjamin at
           Zelzah; and they will say unto thee, The asses which thou
           wentest to seek are found: and, lo, thy father hath left the
           care of the asses, and sorroweth for you, saying, What shall I
           do for my son?

09:010:003 Then shalt thou go on forward from thence, and thou shalt come
           to the plain of Tabor, and there shall meet thee three men
           going up to God to Bethel, one carrying three kids, and
           another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a
           bottle of wine:

09:010:004 And they will salute thee, and give thee two loaves of bread;
           which thou shalt receive of their hands.

09:010:005 After that thou shalt come to the hill of God, where is the
           garrison of the Philistines: and it shall come to pass, when
           thou art come thither to the city, that thou shalt meet a
           company of prophets coming down from the high place with a
           psaltery, and a tabret, and a pipe, and a harp, before them;
           and they shall prophesy:

09:010:006 And the Spirit of the LORD will come upon thee, and thou shalt
           prophesy with them, and shalt be turned into another man.

09:010:007 And let it be, when these signs are come unto thee, that thou
           do as occasion serve thee; for God is with thee.

09:010:008 And thou shalt go down before me to Gilgal; and, behold, I
           will come down unto thee, to offer burnt offerings, and to
           sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings: seven days shalt thou
           tarry, till I come to thee, and shew thee what thou shalt do.

09:010:009 And it was so, that when he had turned his back to go from
           Samuel, God gave him another heart: and all those signs came
           to pass that day.

09:010:010 And when they came thither to the hill, behold, a company of
           prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came upon him, and he
           prophesied among them.

09:010:011 And it came to pass, when all that knew him beforetime saw
           that, behold, he prophesied among the prophets, then the
           people said one to another, What is this that is come unto the
           son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?

09:010:012 And one of the same place answered and said, But who is their
           father? Therefore it became a proverb, Is Saul also among the
           prophets?

09:010:013 And when he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the
           high place.

09:010:014 And Saul's uncle said unto him and to his servant, Whither
           went ye? And he said, To seek the asses: and when we saw that
           they were no where, we came to Samuel.

09:010:015 And Saul's uncle said, Tell me, I pray thee, what Samuel said
           unto you.

09:010:016 And Saul said unto his uncle, He told us plainly that the
           asses were found. But of the matter of the kingdom, whereof
           Samuel spake, he told him not.

09:010:017 And Samuel called the people together unto the LORD to Mizpeh;

09:010:018 And said unto the children of Israel, Thus saith the LORD God
           of Israel, I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and delivered you
           out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all
           kingdoms, and of them that oppressed you:

09:010:019 And ye have this day rejected your God, who himself saved you
           out of all your adversities and your tribulations; and ye have
           said unto him, Nay, but set a king over us. Now therefore
           present yourselves before the LORD by your tribes, and by your
           thousands.

09:010:020 And when Samuel had caused all the tribes of Israel to come
           near, the tribe of Benjamin was taken.

09:010:021 When he had caused the tribe of Benjamin to come near by their
           families, the family of Matri was taken, and Saul the son of
           Kish was taken: and when they sought him, he could not be
           found.

09:010:022 Therefore they enquired of the LORD further, if the man should
           yet come thither. And the LORD answered, Behold he hath hid
           himself among the stuff.

09:010:023 And they ran and fetched him thence: and when he stood among
           the people, he was higher than any of the people from his
           shoulders and upward.

09:010:024 And Samuel said to all the people, See ye him whom the LORD
           hath chosen, that there is none like him among all the people?
           And all the people shouted, and said, God save the king.

09:010:025 Then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom, and
           wrote it in a book, and laid it up before the LORD. And Samuel
           sent all the people away, every man to his house.

09:010:026 And Saul also went home to Gibeah; and there went with him a
           band of men, whose hearts God had touched.

09:010:027 But the children of Belial said, How shall this man save us?
           And they despised him, and brought no presents. But he held
           his peace.

09:011:001 Then Nahash the Ammonite came up, and encamped against
           Jabeshgilead: and all the men of Jabesh said unto Nahash, Make
           a covenant with us, and we will serve thee.

09:011:002 And Nahash the Ammonite answered them, On this condition will
           I make a covenant with you, that I may thrust out all your
           right eyes, and lay it for a reproach upon all Israel.

09:011:003 And the elders of Jabesh said unto him, Give us seven days'
           respite, that we may send messengers unto all the coasts of
           Israel: and then, if there be no man to save us, we will come
           out to thee.

09:011:004 Then came the messengers to Gibeah of Saul, and told the
           tidings in the ears of the people: and all the people lifted
           up their voices, and wept.

09:011:005 And, behold, Saul came after the herd out of the field; and
           Saul said, What aileth the people that they weep? And they
           told him the tidings of the men of Jabesh.

09:011:006 And the Spirit of God came upon Saul when he heard those
           tidings, and his anger was kindled greatly.

09:011:007 And he took a yoke of oxen, and hewed them in pieces, and sent
           them throughout all the coasts of Israel by the hands of
           messengers, saying, Whosoever cometh not forth after Saul and
           after Samuel, so shall it be done unto his oxen. And the fear
           of the LORD fell on the people, and they came out with one
           consent.

09:011:008 And when he numbered them in Bezek, the children of Israel
           were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty
           thousand.

09:011:009 And they said unto the messengers that came, Thus shall ye say
           unto the men of Jabeshgilead, To morrow, by that time the sun
           be hot, ye shall have help. And the messengers came and shewed
           it to the men of Jabesh; and they were glad.

09:011:010 Therefore the men of Jabesh said, To morrow we will come out
           unto you, and ye shall do with us all that seemeth good unto
           you.

09:011:011 And it was so on the morrow, that Saul put the people in three
           companies; and they came into the midst of the host in the
           morning watch, and slew the Ammonites until the heat of the
           day: and it came to pass, that they which remained were
           scattered, so that two of them were not left together.

09:011:012 And the people said unto Samuel, Who is he that said, Shall
           Saul reign over us? bring the men, that we may put them to
           death.

09:011:013 And Saul said, There shall not a man be put to death this day:
           for to day the LORD hath wrought salvation in Israel.

09:011:014 Then said Samuel to the people, Come, and let us go to Gilgal,
           and renew the kingdom there.

09:011:015 And all the people went to Gilgal; and there they made Saul
           king before the LORD in Gilgal; and there they sacrificed
           sacrifices of peace offerings before the LORD; and there Saul
           and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly.

09:012:001 And Samuel said unto all Israel, Behold, I have hearkened unto
           your voice in all that ye said unto me, and have made a king
           over you.

09:012:002 And now, behold, the king walketh before you: and I am old and
           grayheaded; and, behold, my sons are with you: and I have
           walked before you from my childhood unto this day.

09:012:003 Behold, here I am: witness against me before the LORD, and
           before his anointed: whose ox have I taken? or whose ass have
           I taken? or whom have I defrauded? whom have I oppressed? or
           of whose hand have I received any bribe to blind mine eyes
           therewith? and I will restore it you.

09:012:004 And they said, Thou hast not defrauded us, nor oppressed us,
           neither hast thou taken ought of any man's hand.

09:012:005 And he said unto them, The LORD is witness against you, and
           his anointed is witness this day, that ye have not found ought
           in my hand. And they answered, He is witness.

09:012:006 And Samuel said unto the people, It is the LORD that advanced
           Moses and Aaron, and that brought your fathers up out of the
           land of Egypt.

09:012:007 Now therefore stand still, that I may reason with you before
           the LORD of all the righteous acts of the LORD, which he did
           to you and to your fathers.

09:012:008 When Jacob was come into Egypt, and your fathers cried unto
           the LORD, then the LORD sent Moses and Aaron, which brought
           forth your fathers out of Egypt, and made them dwell in this
           place.

09:012:009 And when they forgat the LORD their God, he sold them into the
           hand of Sisera, captain of the host of Hazor, and into the
           hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of
           Moab, and they fought against them.

09:012:010 And they cried unto the LORD, and said, We have sinned,
           because we have forsaken the LORD, and have served Baalim and
           Ashtaroth: but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies,
           and we will serve thee.

09:012:011 And the LORD sent Jerubbaal, and Bedan, and Jephthah, and
           Samuel, and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on
           every side, and ye dwelled safe.

09:012:012 And when ye saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon
           came against you, ye said unto me, Nay; but a king shall reign
           over us: when the LORD your God was your king.

09:012:013 Now therefore behold the king whom ye have chosen, and whom ye
           have desired! and, behold, the LORD hath set a king over you.

09:012:014 If ye will fear the LORD, and serve him, and obey his voice,
           and not rebel against the commandment of the LORD, then shall
           both ye and also the king that reigneth over you continue
           following the LORD your God:

09:012:015 But if ye will not obey the voice of the LORD, but rebel
           against the commandment of the LORD, then shall the hand of
           the LORD be against you, as it was against your fathers.

09:012:016 Now therefore stand and see this great thing, which the LORD
           will do before your eyes.

09:012:017 Is it not wheat harvest to day? I will call unto the LORD, and
           he shall send thunder and rain; that ye may perceive and see
           that your wickedness is great, which ye have done in the sight
           of the LORD, in asking you a king.

09:012:018 So Samuel called unto the LORD; and the LORD sent thunder and
           rain that day: and all the people greatly feared the LORD and
           Samuel.

09:012:019 And all the people said unto Samuel, Pray for thy servants
           unto the LORD thy God, that we die not: for we have added unto
           all our sins this evil, to ask us a king.

09:012:020 And Samuel said unto the people, Fear not: ye have done all
           this wickedness: yet turn not aside from following the LORD,
           but serve the LORD with all your heart;

09:012:021 And turn ye not aside: for then should ye go after vain
           things, which cannot profit nor deliver; for they are vain.

09:012:022 For the LORD will not forsake his people for his great name's
           sake: because it hath pleased the LORD to make you his people.

09:012:023 Moreover as for me, God forbid that I should sin against the
           LORD in ceasing to pray for you: but I will teach you the good
           and the right way:

09:012:024 Only fear the LORD, and serve him in truth with all your
           heart: for consider how great things he hath done for you.

09:012:025 But if ye shall still do wickedly, ye shall be consumed, both
           ye and your king.

09:013:001 Saul reigned one year; and when he had reigned two years over
           Israel,

09:013:002 Saul chose him three thousand men of Israel; whereof two
           thousand were with Saul in Michmash and in mount Bethel, and a
           thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin: and the
           rest of the people he sent every man to his tent.

09:013:003 And Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that was in
           Geba, and the Philistines heard of it. And Saul blew the
           trumpet throughout all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear.

09:013:004 And all Israel heard say that Saul had smitten a garrison of
           the Philistines, and that Israel also was had in abomination
           with the Philistines. And the people were called together
           after Saul to Gilgal.

09:013:005 And the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight with
           Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen,
           and people as the sand which is on the sea shore in multitude:
           and they came up, and pitched in Michmash, eastward from
           Bethaven.

09:013:006 When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait, (for
           the people were distressed,) then the people did hide
           themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in
           high places, and in pits.

09:013:007 And some of the Hebrews went over Jordan to the land of Gad
           and Gilead. As for Saul, he was yet in Gilgal, and all the
           people followed him trembling.

09:013:008 And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that
           Samuel had appointed: but Samuel came not to Gilgal; and the
           people were scattered from him.

09:013:009 And Saul said, Bring hither a burnt offering to me, and peace
           offerings. And he offered the burnt offering.

09:013:010 And it came to pass, that as soon as he had made an end of
           offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul
           went out to meet him, that he might salute him.

09:013:011 And Samuel said, What hast thou done? And Saul said, Because I
           saw that the people were scattered from me, and that thou
           camest not within the days appointed, and that the Philistines
           gathered themselves together at Michmash;

09:013:012 Therefore said I, The Philistines will come down now upon me
           to Gilgal, and I have not made supplication unto the LORD: I
           forced myself therefore, and offered a burnt offering.

09:013:013 And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast
           not kept the commandment of the LORD thy God, which he
           commanded thee: for now would the LORD have established thy
           kingdom upon Israel for ever.

09:013:014 But now thy kingdom shall not continue: the LORD hath sought
           him a man after his own heart, and the LORD hath commanded him
           to be captain over his people, because thou hast not kept that
           which the LORD commanded thee.

09:013:015 And Samuel arose, and gat him up from Gilgal unto Gibeah of
           Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people that were present with
           him, about six hundred men.

09:013:016 And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people that were
           present with them, abode in Gibeah of Benjamin: but the
           Philistines encamped in Michmash.

09:013:017 And the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in
           three companies: one company turned unto the way that leadeth
           to Ophrah, unto the land of Shual:

09:013:018 And another company turned the way to Bethhoron: and another
           company turned to the way of the border that looketh to the
           valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.

09:013:019 Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of
           Israel: for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make them
           swords or spears:

09:013:020 But all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to
           sharpen every man his share, and his coulter, and his axe, and
           his mattock.

09:013:021 Yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the coulters,
           and for the forks, and for the axes, and to sharpen the goads.

09:013:022 So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was
           neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people
           that were with Saul and Jonathan: but with Saul and with
           Jonathan his son was there found.

09:013:023 And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the passage of
           Michmash.

09:014:001 Now it came to pass upon a day, that Jonathan the son of Saul
           said unto the young man that bare his armour, Come, and let us
           go over to the Philistines' garrison, that is on the other
           side. But he told not his father.

09:014:002 And Saul tarried in the uttermost part of Gibeah under a
           pomegranate tree which is in Migron: and the people that were
           with him were about six hundred men;

09:014:003 And Ahiah, the son of Ahitub, Ichabod's brother, the son of
           Phinehas, the son of Eli, the LORD's priest in Shiloh, wearing
           an ephod. And the people knew not that Jonathan was gone.

09:014:004 And between the passages, by which Jonathan sought to go over
           unto the Philistines' garrison, there was a sharp rock on the
           one side, and a sharp rock on the other side: and the name of
           the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.

09:014:005 The forefront of the one was situate northward over against
           Michmash, and the other southward over against Gibeah.

09:014:006 And Jonathan said to the young man that bare his armour, Come,
           and let us go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised:
           it may be that the LORD will work for us: for there is no
           restraint to the LORD to save by many or by few.

09:014:007 And his armourbearer said unto him, Do all that is in thine
           heart: turn thee; behold, I am with thee according to thy
           heart.

09:014:008 Then said Jonathan, Behold, we will pass over unto these men,
           and we will discover ourselves unto them.

09:014:009 If they say thus unto us, Tarry until we come to you; then we
           will stand still in our place, and will not go up unto them.

09:014:010 But if they say thus, Come up unto us; then we will go up: for
           the LORD hath delivered them into our hand: and this shall be
           a sign unto us.

09:014:011 And both of them discovered themselves unto the garrison of
           the Philistines: and the Philistines said, Behold, the Hebrews
           come forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves.

09:014:012 And the men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his
           armourbearer, and said, Come up to us, and we will shew you a
           thing. And Jonathan said unto his armourbearer, Come up after
           me: for the LORD hath delivered them into the hand of Israel.

09:014:013 And Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet, and
           his armourbearer after him: and they fell before Jonathan; and
           his armourbearer slew after him.

09:014:014 And that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armourbearer
           made, was about twenty men, within as it were an half acre of
           land, which a yoke of oxen might plow.

09:014:015 And there was trembling in the host, in the field, and among
           all the people: the garrison, and the spoilers, they also
           trembled, and the earth quaked: so it was a very great
           trembling.

09:014:016 And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and,
           behold, the multitude melted away, and they went on beating
           down one another.

09:014:017 Then said Saul unto the people that were with him, Number now,
           and see who is gone from us. And when they had numbered,
           behold, Jonathan and his armourbearer were not there.

09:014:018 And Saul said unto Ahiah, Bring hither the ark of God. For the
           ark of God was at that time with the children of Israel.

09:014:019 And it came to pass, while Saul talked unto the priest, that
           the noise that was in the host of the Philistines went on and
           increased: and Saul said unto the priest, Withdraw thine hand.

09:014:020 And Saul and all the people that were with him assembled
           themselves, and they came to the battle: and, behold, every
           man's sword was against his fellow, and there was a very great
           discomfiture.

09:014:021 Moreover the Hebrews that were with the Philistines before
           that time, which went up with them into the camp from the
           country round about, even they also turned to be with the
           Israelites that were with Saul and Jonathan.

09:014:022 Likewise all the men of Israel which had hid themselves in
           mount Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines fled, even
           they also followed hard after them in the battle.

09:014:023 So the LORD saved Israel that day: and the battle passed over
           unto Bethaven.

09:014:024 And the men of Israel were distressed that day: for Saul had
           adjured the people, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth any
           food until evening, that I may be avenged on mine enemies. So
           none of the people tasted any food.

09:014:025 And all they of the land came to a wood; and there was honey
           upon the ground.

09:014:026 And when the people were come into the wood, behold, the honey
           dropped; but no man put his hand to his mouth: for the people
           feared the oath.

09:014:027 But Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with
           the oath: wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that was
           in his hand, and dipped it in an honeycomb, and put his hand
           to his mouth; and his eyes were enlightened.

09:014:028 Then answered one of the people, and said, Thy father straitly
           charged the people with an oath, saying, Cursed be the man
           that eateth any food this day. And the people were faint.

09:014:029 Then said Jonathan, My father hath troubled the land: see, I
           pray you, how mine eyes have been enlightened, because I
           tasted a little of this honey.

09:014:030 How much more, if haply the people had eaten freely to day of
           the spoil of their enemies which they found? for had there not
           been now a much greater slaughter among the Philistines?

09:014:031 And they smote the Philistines that day from Michmash to
           Aijalon: and the people were very faint.

09:014:032 And the people flew upon the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen,
           and calves, and slew them on the ground: and the people did
           eat them with the blood.

09:014:033 Then they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin against
           the LORD, in that they eat with the blood. And he said, Ye
           have transgressed: roll a great stone unto me this day.

09:014:034 And Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say
           unto them, Bring me hither every man his ox, and every man his
           sheep, and slay them here, and eat; and sin not against the
           LORD in eating with the blood. And all the people brought
           every man his ox with him that night, and slew them there.

09:014:035 And Saul built an altar unto the LORD: the same was the first
           altar that he built unto the LORD.

09:014:036 And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night,
           and spoil them until the morning light, and let us not leave a
           man of them. And they said, Do whatsoever seemeth good unto
           thee. Then said the priest, Let us draw near hither unto God.

09:014:037 And Saul asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the
           Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into the hand of Israel?
           But he answered him not that day.

09:014:038 And Saul said, Draw ye near hither, all the chief of the
           people: and know and see wherein this sin hath been this day.

09:014:039 For, as the LORD liveth, which saveth Israel, though it be in
           Jonathan my son, he shall surely die. But there was not a man
           among all the people that answered him.

09:014:040 Then said he unto all Israel, Be ye on one side, and I and
           Jonathan my son will be on the other side. And the people said
           unto Saul, Do what seemeth good unto thee.

09:014:041 Therefore Saul said unto the LORD God of Israel, Give a
           perfect lot. And Saul and Jonathan were taken: but the people
           escaped.

09:014:042 And Saul said, Cast lots between me and Jonathan my son. And
           Jonathan was taken.

09:014:043 Then Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what thou hast done. And
           Jonathan told him, and said, I did but taste a little honey
           with the end of the rod that was in mine hand, and, lo, I must
           die.

09:014:044 And Saul answered, God do so and more also: for thou shalt
           surely die, Jonathan.

09:014:045 And the people said unto Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who hath
           wrought this great salvation in Israel? God forbid: as the
           LORD liveth, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the
           ground; for he hath wrought with God this day. So the people
           rescued Jonathan, that he died not.

09:014:046 Then Saul went up from following the Philistines: and the
           Philistines went to their own place.

09:014:047 So Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and fought against all
           his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the
           children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of
           Zobah, and against the Philistines: and whithersoever he
           turned himself, he vexed them.

09:014:048 And he gathered an host, and smote the Amalekites, and
           delivered Israel out of the hands of them that spoiled them.

09:014:049 Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishui, and Melchishua:
           and the names of his two daughters were these; the name of the
           firstborn Merab, and the name of the younger Michal:

09:014:050 And the name of Saul's wife was Ahinoam, the daughter of
           Ahimaaz: and the name of the captain of his host was Abner,
           the son of Ner, Saul's uncle.

09:014:051 And Kish was the father of Saul; and Ner the father of Abner
           was the son of Abiel.

09:014:052 And there was sore war against the Philistines all the days of
           Saul: and when Saul saw any strong man, or any valiant man, he
           took him unto him.

09:015:001 Samuel also said unto Saul, The LORD sent me to anoint thee to
           be king over his people, over Israel: now therefore hearken
           thou unto the voice of the words of the LORD.

09:015:002 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I remember that which Amalek did
           to Israel, how he laid wait for him in the way, when he came
           up from Egypt.

09:015:003 Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they
           have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant
           and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.

09:015:004 And Saul gathered the people together, and numbered them in
           Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of
           Judah.

09:015:005 And Saul came to a city of Amalek, and laid wait in the
           valley.

09:015:006 And Saul said unto the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down from
           among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them: for ye
           shewed kindness to all the children of Israel, when they came
           up out of Egypt. So the Kenites departed from among the
           Amalekites.

09:015:007 And Saul smote the Amalekites from Havilah until thou comest
           to Shur, that is over against Egypt.

09:015:008 And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly
           destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.

09:015:009 But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the
           sheep, and of the oxen, and of the fatlings, and the lambs,
           and all that was good, and would not utterly destroy them: but
           every thing that was vile and refuse, that they destroyed
           utterly.

09:015:010 Then came the word of the LORD unto Samuel, saying,

09:015:011 It repenteth me that I have set up Saul to be king: for he is
           turned back from following me, and hath not performed my
           commandments. And it grieved Samuel; and he cried unto the
           LORD all night.

09:015:012 And when Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning, it was
           told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and, behold, he set
           him up a place, and is gone about, and passed on, and gone
           down to Gilgal.

09:015:013 And Samuel came to Saul: and Saul said unto him, Blessed be
           thou of the LORD: I have performed the commandment of the
           LORD.

09:015:014 And Samuel said, What meaneth then this bleating of the sheep
           in mine ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?

09:015:015 And Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites: for
           the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to
           sacrifice unto the LORD thy God; and the rest we have utterly
           destroyed.

09:015:016 Then Samuel said unto Saul, Stay, and I will tell thee what
           the LORD hath said to me this night. And he said unto him, Say
           on.

09:015:017 And Samuel said, When thou wast little in thine own sight,
           wast thou not made the head of the tribes of Israel, and the
           LORD anointed thee king over Israel?

09:015:018 And the LORD sent thee on a journey, and said, Go and utterly
           destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them
           until they be consumed.

09:015:019 Wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of the LORD, but
           didst fly upon the spoil, and didst evil in the sight of the
           LORD?

09:015:020 And Saul said unto Samuel, Yea, I have obeyed the voice of the
           LORD, and have gone the way which the LORD sent me, and have
           brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed
           the Amalekites.

09:015:021 But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of
           the things which should have been utterly destroyed, to
           sacrifice unto the LORD thy God in Gilgal.

09:015:022 And Samuel said, Hath the LORD as great delight in burnt
           offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the LORD?
           Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than
           the fat of rams.

09:015:023 For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is
           as iniquity and idolatry. Because thou hast rejected the word
           of the LORD, he hath also rejected thee from being king.

09:015:024 And Saul said unto Samuel, I have sinned: for I have
           transgressed the commandment of the LORD, and thy words:
           because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice.

09:015:025 Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon my sin, and turn again with
           me, that I may worship the LORD.

09:015:026 And Samuel said unto Saul, I will not return with thee: for
           thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD hath
           rejected thee from being king over Israel.

09:015:027 And as Samuel turned about to go away, he laid hold upon the
           skirt of his mantle, and it rent.

09:015:028 And Samuel said unto him, The LORD hath rent the kingdom of
           Israel from thee this day, and hath given it to a neighbour of
           thine, that is better than thou.

09:015:029 And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent: for
           he is not a man, that he should repent.

09:015:030 Then he said, I have sinned: yet honour me now, I pray thee,
           before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and turn
           again with me, that I may worship the LORD thy God.

09:015:031 So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshipped the
           LORD.

09:015:032 Then said Samuel, Bring ye hither to me Agag the king of the
           Amalekites. And Agag came unto him delicately. And Agag said,
           Surely the bitterness of death is past.

09:015:033 And Samuel said, As the sword hath made women childless, so
           shall thy mother be childless among women. And Samuel hewed
           Agag in pieces before the LORD in Gilgal.

09:015:034 Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to
           Gibeah of Saul.

09:015:035 And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his
           death: nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul: and the LORD
           repented that he had made Saul king over Israel.

09:016:001 And the LORD said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for
           Saul, seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel?
           fill thine horn with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse
           the Bethlehemite: for I have provided me a king among his
           sons.

09:016:002 And Samuel said, How can I go? if Saul hear it, he will kill
           me. And the LORD said, Take an heifer with thee, and say, I am
           come to sacrifice to the LORD.

09:016:003 And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will shew thee what
           thou shalt do: and thou shalt anoint unto me him whom I name
           unto thee.

09:016:004 And Samuel did that which the LORD spake, and came to
           Bethlehem. And the elders of the town trembled at his coming,
           and said, Comest thou peaceably?

09:016:005 And he said, Peaceably: I am come to sacrifice unto the LORD:
           sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice. And he
           sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the
           sacrifice.

09:016:006 And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on
           Eliab, and said, Surely the LORD's anointed is before him.

09:016:007 But the LORD said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or
           on the height of his stature; because I have refused him: for
           the LORD seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the
           outward appearance, but the LORD looketh on the heart.

09:016:008 Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel.
           And he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this.

09:016:009 Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, Neither hath
           the LORD chosen this.

09:016:010 Again, Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And
           Samuel said unto Jesse, The LORD hath not chosen these.

09:016:011 And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all thy children? And he
           said, There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he
           keepeth the sheep. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Send and fetch
           him: for we will not sit down till he come hither.

09:016:012 And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and withal
           of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to. And the
           LORD said, Arise, anoint him: for this is he.

09:016:013 Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the
           midst of his brethren: and the Spirit of the LORD came upon
           David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to
           Ramah.

09:016:014 But the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an evil
           spirit from the LORD troubled him.

09:016:015 And Saul's servants said unto him, Behold now, an evil spirit
           from God troubleth thee.

09:016:016 Let our lord now command thy servants, which are before thee,
           to seek out a man, who is a cunning player on an harp: and it
           shall come to pass, when the evil spirit from God is upon
           thee, that he shall play with his hand, and thou shalt be
           well.

09:016:017 And Saul said unto his servants, Provide me now a man that can
           play well, and bring him to me.

09:016:018 Then answered one of the servants, and said, Behold, I have
           seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, that is cunning in
           playing, and a mighty valiant man, and a man of war, and
           prudent in matters, and a comely person, and the LORD is with
           him.

09:016:019 Wherefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse, and said, Send me
           David thy son, which is with the sheep.

09:016:020 And Jesse took an ass laden with bread, and a bottle of wine,
           and a kid, and sent them by David his son unto Saul.

09:016:021 And David came to Saul, and stood before him: and he loved him
           greatly; and he became his armourbearer.

09:016:022 And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Let David, I pray thee, stand
           before me; for he hath found favour in my sight.

09:016:023 And it came to pass, when the evil spirit from God was upon
           Saul, that David took an harp, and played with his hand: so
           Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed
           from him.

09:017:001 Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle,
           and were gathered together at Shochoh, which belongeth to
           Judah, and pitched between Shochoh and Azekah, in Ephesdammim.

09:017:002 And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together, and
           pitched by the valley of Elah, and set the battle in array
           against the Philistines.

09:017:003 And the Philistines stood on a mountain on the one side, and
           Israel stood on a mountain on the other side: and there was a
           valley between them.

09:017:004 And there went out a champion out of the camp of the
           Philistines, named Goliath, of Gath, whose height was six
           cubits and a span.

09:017:005 And he had an helmet of brass upon his head, and he was armed
           with a coat of mail; and the weight of the coat was five
           thousand shekels of brass.

09:017:006 And he had greaves of brass upon his legs, and a target of
           brass between his shoulders.

09:017:007 And the staff of his spear was like a weaver's beam; and his
           spear's head weighed six hundred shekels of iron: and one
           bearing a shield went before him.

09:017:008 And he stood and cried unto the armies of Israel, and said
           unto them, Why are ye come out to set your battle in array? am
           not I a Philistine, and ye servants to Saul? choose you a man
           for you, and let him come down to me.

09:017:009 If he be able to fight with me, and to kill me, then will we
           be your servants: but if I prevail against him, and kill him,
           then shall ye be our servants, and serve us.

09:017:010 And the Philistine said, I defy the armies of Israel this day;
           give me a man, that we may fight together.

09:017:011 When Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine,
           they were dismayed, and greatly afraid.

09:017:012 Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehemjudah,
           whose name was Jesse; and he had eight sons: and the man went
           among men for an old man in the days of Saul.

09:017:013 And the three eldest sons of Jesse went and followed Saul to
           the battle: and the names of his three sons that went to the
           battle were Eliab the firstborn, and next unto him Abinadab,
           and the third Shammah.

09:017:014 And David was the youngest: and the three eldest followed
           Saul.

09:017:015 But David went and returned from Saul to feed his father's
           sheep at Bethlehem.

09:017:016 And the Philistine drew near morning and evening, and
           presented himself forty days.

09:017:017 And Jesse said unto David his son, Take now for thy brethren
           an ephah of this parched corn, and these ten loaves, and run
           to the camp of thy brethren;

09:017:018 And carry these ten cheeses unto the captain of their
           thousand, and look how thy brethren fare, and take their
           pledge.

09:017:019 Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel, were in the
           valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines.

09:017:020 And David rose up early in the morning, and left the sheep
           with a keeper, and took, and went, as Jesse had commanded him;
           and he came to the trench, as the host was going forth to the
           fight, and shouted for the battle.

09:017:021 For Israel and the Philistines had put the battle in array,
           army against army.

09:017:022 And David left his carriage in the hand of the keeper of the
           carriage, and ran into the army, and came and saluted his
           brethren.

09:017:023 And as he talked with them, behold, there came up the
           champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, out of the
           armies of the Philistines, and spake according to the same
           words: and David heard them.

09:017:024 And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from
           him, and were sore afraid.

09:017:025 And the men of Israel said, Have ye seen this man that is come
           up? surely to defy Israel is he come up: and it shall be, that
           the man who killeth him, the king will enrich him with great
           riches, and will give him his daughter, and make his father's
           house free in Israel.

09:017:026 And David spake to the men that stood by him, saying, What
           shall be done to the man that killeth this Philistine, and
           taketh away the reproach from Israel? for who is this
           uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of
           the living God?

09:017:027 And the people answered him after this manner, saying, So
           shall it be done to the man that killeth him.

09:017:028 And Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spake unto the men;
           and Eliab's anger was kindled against David, and he said, Why
           camest thou down hither? and with whom hast thou left those
           few sheep in the wilderness? I know thy pride, and the
           naughtiness of thine heart; for thou art come down that thou
           mightest see the battle.

09:017:029 And David said, What have I now done? Is there not a cause?

09:017:030 And he turned from him toward another, and spake after the
           same manner: and the people answered him again after the
           former manner.

09:017:031 And when the words were heard which David spake, they
           rehearsed them before Saul: and he sent for him.

09:017:032 And David said to Saul, Let no man's heart fail because of
           him; thy servant will go and fight with this Philistine.

09:017:033 And Saul said to David, Thou art not able to go against this
           Philistine to fight with him: for thou art but a youth, and he
           a man of war from his youth.

09:017:034 And David said unto Saul, Thy servant kept his father's sheep,
           and there came a lion, and a bear, and took a lamb out of the
           flock:

09:017:035 And I went out after him, and smote him, and delivered it out
           of his mouth: and when he arose against me, I caught him by
           his beard, and smote him, and slew him.

09:017:036 Thy servant slew both the lion and the bear: and this
           uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, seeing he
           hath defied the armies of the living God.

09:017:037 David said moreover, The LORD that delivered me out of the paw
           of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver
           me out of the hand of this Philistine. And Saul said unto
           David, Go, and the LORD be with thee.

09:017:038 And Saul armed David with his armour, and he put an helmet of
           brass upon his head; also he armed him with a coat of mail.

09:017:039 And David girded his sword upon his armour, and he assayed to
           go; for he had not proved it. And David said unto Saul, I
           cannot go with these; for I have not proved them. And David
           put them off him.

09:017:040 And he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth
           stones out of the brook, and put them in a shepherd's bag
           which he had, even in a scrip; and his sling was in his hand:
           and he drew near to the Philistine.

09:017:041 And the Philistine came on and drew near unto David; and the
           man that bare the shield went before him.

09:017:042 And when the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he
           disdained him: for he was but a youth, and ruddy, and of a
           fair countenance.

09:017:043 And the Philistine said unto David, Am I a dog, that thou
           comest to me with staves? And the Philistine cursed David by
           his gods.

09:017:044 And the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give
           thy flesh unto the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the
           field.

09:017:045 Then said David to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with a
           sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to thee
           in the name of the LORD of hosts, the God of the armies of
           Israel, whom thou hast defied.

09:017:046 This day will the LORD deliver thee into mine hand; and I will
           smite thee, and take thine head from thee; and I will give the
           carcases of the host of the Philistines this day unto the
           fowls of the air, and to the wild beasts of the earth; that
           all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel.

09:017:047 And all this assembly shall know that the LORD saveth not with
           sword and spear: for the battle is the LORD's, and he will
           give you into our hands.

09:017:048 And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came, and
           drew nigh to meet David, that David hastened, and ran toward
           the army to meet the Philistine.

09:017:049 And David put his hand in his bag, and took thence a stone,
           and slang it, and smote the Philistine in his forehead, that
           the stone sunk into his forehead; and he fell upon his face to
           the earth.

09:017:050 So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a
           stone, and smote the Philistine, and slew him; but there was
           no sword in the hand of David.

09:017:051 Therefore David ran, and stood upon the Philistine, and took
           his sword, and drew it out of the sheath thereof, and slew
           him, and cut off his head therewith. And when the Philistines
           saw their champion was dead, they fled.

09:017:052 And the men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and
           pursued the Philistines, until thou come to the valley, and to
           the gates of Ekron. And the wounded of the Philistines fell
           down by the way to Shaaraim, even unto Gath, and unto Ekron.

09:017:053 And the children of Israel returned from chasing after the
           Philistines, and they spoiled their tents.

09:017:054 And David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to
           Jerusalem; but he put his armour in his tent.

09:017:055 And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he
           said unto Abner, the captain of the host, Abner, whose son is
           this youth? And Abner said, As thy soul liveth, O king, I
           cannot tell.

09:017:056 And the king said, Enquire thou whose son the stripling is.

09:017:057 And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine,
           Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of
           the Philistine in his hand.

09:017:058 And Saul said to him, Whose son art thou, thou young man? And
           David answered, I am the son of thy servant Jesse the
           Bethlehemite.

09:018:001 And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking unto
           Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of
           David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul.

09:018:002 And Saul took him that day, and would let him go no more home
           to his father's house.

09:018:003 Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him
           as his own soul.

09:018:004 And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him,
           and gave it to David, and his garments, even to his sword, and
           to his bow, and to his girdle.

09:018:005 And David went out whithersoever Saul sent him, and behaved
           himself wisely: and Saul set him over the men of war, and he
           was accepted in the sight of all the people, and also in the
           sight of Saul's servants.

09:018:006 And it came to pass as they came, when David was returned from
           the slaughter of the Philistine, that the women came out of
           all cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul,
           with tabrets, with joy, and with instruments of musick.

09:018:007 And the women answered one another as they played, and said,
           Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands.

09:018:008 And Saul was very wroth, and the saying displeased him; and he
           said, They have ascribed unto David ten thousands, and to me
           they have ascribed but thousands: and what can he have more
           but the kingdom?

09:018:009 And Saul eyed David from that day and forward.

09:018:010 And it came to pass on the morrow, that the evil spirit from
           God came upon Saul, and he prophesied in the midst of the
           house: and David played with his hand, as at other times: and
           there was a javelin in Saul's hand.

09:018:011 And Saul cast the javelin; for he said, I will smite David
           even to the wall with it. And David avoided out of his
           presence twice.

09:018:012 And Saul was afraid of David, because the LORD was with him,
           and was departed from Saul.

09:018:013 Therefore Saul removed him from him, and made him his captain
           over a thousand; and he went out and came in before the
           people.

09:018:014 And David behaved himself wisely in all his ways; and the LORD
           was with him.

09:018:015 Wherefore when Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely,
           he was afraid of him.

09:018:016 But all Israel and Judah loved David, because he went out and
           came in before them.

09:018:017 And Saul said to David, Behold my elder daughter Merab, her
           will I give thee to wife: only be thou valiant for me, and
           fight the LORD's battles. For Saul said, Let not mine hand be
           upon him, but let the hand of the Philistines be upon him.

09:018:018 And David said unto Saul, Who am I? and what is my life, or my
           father's family in Israel, that I should be son in law to the
           king?

09:018:019 But it came to pass at the time when Merab Saul's daughter
           should have been given to David, that she was given unto
           Adriel the Meholathite to wife.

09:018:020 And Michal Saul's daughter loved David: and they told Saul,
           and the thing pleased him.

09:018:021 And Saul said, I will give him her, that she may be a snare to
           him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him.
           Wherefore Saul said to David, Thou shalt this day be my son in
           law in the one of the twain.

09:018:022 And Saul commanded his servants, saying, Commune with David
           secretly, and say, Behold, the king hath delight in thee, and
           all his servants love thee: now therefore be the king's son in
           law.

09:018:023 And Saul's servants spake those words in the ears of David.
           And David said, Seemeth it to you a light thing to be a king's
           son in law, seeing that I am a poor man, and lightly esteemed?

09:018:024 And the servants of Saul told him, saying, On this manner
           spake David.

09:018:025 And Saul said, Thus shall ye say to David, The king desireth
           not any dowry, but an hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to
           be avenged of the king's enemies. But Saul thought to make
           David fall by the hand of the Philistines.

09:018:026 And when his servants told David these words, it pleased David
           well to be the king's son in law: and the days were not
           expired.

09:018:027 Wherefore David arose and went, he and his men, and slew of
           the Philistines two hundred men; and David brought their
           foreskins, and they gave them in full tale to the king, that
           he might be the king's son in law. And Saul gave him Michal
           his daughter to wife.

09:018:028 And Saul saw and knew that the LORD was with David, and that
           Michal Saul's daughter loved him.

09:018:029 And Saul was yet the more afraid of David; and Saul became
           David's enemy continually.

09:018:030 Then the princes of the Philistines went forth: and it came to
           pass, after they went forth, that David behaved himself more
           wisely than all the servants of Saul; so that his name was
           much set by.

09:019:001 And Saul spake to Jonathan his son, and to all his servants,
           that they should kill David.

09:019:002 But Jonathan Saul's son delighted much in David: and Jonathan
           told David, saying, Saul my father seeketh to kill thee: now
           therefore, I pray thee, take heed to thyself until the
           morning, and abide in a secret place, and hide thyself:

09:019:003 And I will go out and stand beside my father in the field
           where thou art, and I will commune with my father of thee; and
           what I see, that I will tell thee.

09:019:004 And Jonathan spake good of David unto Saul his father, and
           said unto him, Let not the king sin against his servant,
           against David; because he hath not sinned against thee, and
           because his works have been to thee-ward very good:

09:019:005 For he did put his life in his hand, and slew the Philistine,
           and the LORD wrought a great salvation for all Israel: thou
           sawest it, and didst rejoice: wherefore then wilt thou sin
           against innocent blood, to slay David without a cause?

09:019:006 And Saul hearkened unto the voice of Jonathan: and Saul sware,
           As the LORD liveth, he shall not be slain.

09:019:007 And Jonathan called David, and Jonathan shewed him all those
           things. And Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his
           presence, as in times past.

09:019:008 And there was war again: and David went out, and fought with
           the Philistines, and slew them with a great slaughter; and
           they fled from him.

09:019:009 And the evil spirit from the LORD was upon Saul, as he sat in
           his house with his javelin in his hand: and David played with
           his hand.

09:019:010 And Saul sought to smite David even to the wall with the
           javelin: but he slipped away out of Saul's presence, and he
           smote the javelin into the wall: and David fled, and escaped
           that night.

09:019:011 Saul also sent messengers unto David's house, to watch him,
           and to slay him in the morning: and Michal David's wife told
           him, saying, If thou save not thy life to night, to morrow
           thou shalt be slain.

09:019:012 So Michal let David down through a window: and he went, and
           fled, and escaped.

09:019:013 And Michal took an image, and laid it in the bed, and put a
           pillow of goats' hair for his bolster, and covered it with a
           cloth.

09:019:014 And when Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, He is
           sick.

09:019:015 And Saul sent the messengers again to see David, saying, Bring
           him up to me in the bed, that I may slay him.

09:019:016 And when the messengers were come in, behold, there was an
           image in the bed, with a pillow of goats' hair for his
           bolster.

09:019:017 And Saul said unto Michal, Why hast thou deceived me so, and
           sent away mine enemy, that he is escaped? And Michal answered
           Saul, He said unto me, Let me go; why should I kill thee?

09:019:018 So David fled, and escaped, and came to Samuel to Ramah, and
           told him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went
           and dwelt in Naioth.

09:019:019 And it was told Saul, saying, Behold, David is at Naioth in
           Ramah.

09:019:020 And Saul sent messengers to take David: and when they saw the
           company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as
           appointed over them, the Spirit of God was upon the messengers
           of Saul, and they also prophesied.

09:019:021 And when it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they
           prophesied likewise. And Saul sent messengers again the third
           time, and they prophesied also.

09:019:022 Then went he also to Ramah, and came to a great well that is
           in Sechu: and he asked and said, Where are Samuel and David?
           And one said, Behold, they be at Naioth in Ramah.

09:019:023 And he went thither to Naioth in Ramah: and the Spirit of God
           was upon him also, and he went on, and prophesied, until he
           came to Naioth in Ramah.

09:019:024 And he stripped off his clothes also, and prophesied before
           Samuel in like manner, and lay down naked all that day and all
           that night. Wherefore they say, Is Saul also among the
           prophets?

09:020:001 And David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said before
           Jonathan, What have I done? what is mine iniquity? and what is
           my sin before thy father, that he seeketh my life?

09:020:002 And he said unto him, God forbid; thou shalt not die: behold,
           my father will do nothing either great or small, but that he
           will shew it me: and why should my father hide this thing from
           me? it is not so.

09:020:003 And David sware moreover, and said, Thy father certainly
           knoweth that I have found grace in thine eyes; and he saith,
           Let not Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved: but truly as
           the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, there is but a step
           between me and death.

09:020:004 Then said Jonathan unto David, Whatsoever thy soul desireth, I
           will even do it for thee.

09:020:005 And David said unto Jonathan, Behold, to morrow is the new
           moon, and I should not fail to sit with the king at meat: but
           let me go, that I may hide myself in the field unto the third
           day at even.

09:020:006 If thy father at all miss me, then say, David earnestly asked
           leave of me that he might run to Bethlehem his city: for there
           is a yearly sacrifice there for all the family.

09:020:007 If he say thus, It is well; thy servant shall have peace: but
           if he be very wroth, then be sure that evil is determined by
           him.

09:020:008 Therefore thou shalt deal kindly with thy servant; for thou
           hast brought thy servant into a covenant of the LORD with
           thee: notwithstanding, if there be in me iniquity, slay me
           thyself; for why shouldest thou bring me to thy father?

09:020:009 And Jonathan said, Far be it from thee: for if I knew
           certainly that evil were determined by my father to come upon
           thee, then would not I tell it thee?

09:020:010 Then said David to Jonathan, Who shall tell me? or what if thy
           father answer thee roughly?

09:020:011 And Jonathan said unto David, Come, and let us go out into the
           field. And they went out both of them into the field.

09:020:012 And Jonathan said unto David, O LORD God of Israel, when I
           have sounded my father about to morrow any time, or the third
           day, and, behold, if there be good toward David, and I then
           send not unto thee, and shew it thee;

09:020:013 The LORD do so and much more to Jonathan: but if it please my
           father to do thee evil, then I will shew it thee, and send
           thee away, that thou mayest go in peace: and the LORD be with
           thee, as he hath been with my father.

09:020:014 And thou shalt not only while yet I live shew me the kindness
           of the LORD, that I die not:

09:020:015 But also thou shalt not cut off thy kindness from my house for
           ever: no, not when the LORD hath cut off the enemies of David
           every one from the face of the earth.

09:020:016 So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying,
           Let the LORD even require it at the hand of David's enemies.

09:020:017 And Jonathan caused David to swear again, because he loved
           him: for he loved him as he loved his own soul.

09:020:018 Then Jonathan said to David, To morrow is the new moon: and
           thou shalt be missed, because thy seat will be empty.

09:020:019 And when thou hast stayed three days, then thou shalt go down
           quickly, and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself
           when the business was in hand, and shalt remain by the stone
           Ezel.

09:020:020 And I will shoot three arrows on the side thereof, as though I
           shot at a mark.

09:020:021 And, behold, I will send a lad, saying, Go, find out the
           arrows. If I expressly say unto the lad, Behold, the arrows
           are on this side of thee, take them; then come thou: for there
           is peace to thee, and no hurt; as the LORD liveth.

09:020:022 But if I say thus unto the young man, Behold, the arrows are
           beyond thee; go thy way: for the LORD hath sent thee away.

09:020:023 And as touching the matter which thou and I have spoken of,
           behold, the LORD be between thee and me for ever.

09:020:024 So David hid himself in the field: and when the new moon was
           come, the king sat him down to eat meat.

09:020:025 And the king sat upon his seat, as at other times, even upon a
           seat by the wall: and Jonathan arose, and Abner sat by Saul's
           side, and David's place was empty.

09:020:026 Nevertheless Saul spake not any thing that day: for he
           thought, Something hath befallen him, he is not clean; surely
           he is not clean.

09:020:027 And it came to pass on the morrow, which was the second day of
           the month, that David's place was empty: and Saul said unto
           Jonathan his son, Wherefore cometh not the son of Jesse to
           meat, neither yesterday, nor to day?

09:020:028 And Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked leave of me
           to go to Bethlehem:

09:020:029 And he said, Let me go, I pray thee; for our family hath a
           sacrifice in the city; and my brother, he hath commanded me to
           be there: and now, if I have found favour in thine eyes, let
           me get away, I pray thee, and see my brethren. Therefore he
           cometh not unto the king's table.

09:020:030 Then Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said
           unto him, Thou son of the perverse rebellious woman, do not I
           know that thou hast chosen the son of Jesse to thine own
           confusion, and unto the confusion of thy mother's nakedness?

09:020:031 For as long as the son of Jesse liveth upon the ground, thou
           shalt not be established, nor thy kingdom. Wherefore now send
           and fetch him unto me, for he shall surely die.

09:020:032 And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said unto him,
           Wherefore shall he be slain? what hath he done?

09:020:033 And Saul cast a javelin at him to smite him: whereby Jonathan
           knew that it was determined of his father to slay David.

09:020:034 So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did eat
           no meat the second day of the month: for he was grieved for
           David, because his father had done him shame.

09:020:035 And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out
           into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little
           lad with him.

09:020:036 And he said unto his lad, Run, find out now the arrows which I
           shoot. And as the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.

09:020:037 And when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which
           Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the lad, and said, Is
           not the arrow beyond thee?

09:020:038 And Jonathan cried after the lad, Make speed, haste, stay not.
           And Jonathan's lad gathered up the arrows, and came to his
           master.

09:020:039 But the lad knew not any thing: only Jonathan and David knew
           the matter.

09:020:040 And Jonathan gave his artillery unto his lad, and said unto
           him, Go, carry them to the city.

09:020:041 And as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of a place
           toward the south, and fell on his face to the ground, and
           bowed himself three times: and they kissed one another, and
           wept one with another, until David exceeded.

09:020:042 And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, forasmuch as we have
           sworn both of us in the name of the LORD, saying, The LORD be
           between me and thee, and between my seed and thy seed for
           ever. And he arose and departed: and Jonathan went into the
           city.

09:021:001 Then came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest: and Ahimelech
           was afraid at the meeting of David, and said unto him, Why art
           thou alone, and no man with thee?

09:021:002 And David said unto Ahimelech the priest, The king hath
           commanded me a business, and hath said unto me, Let no man
           know any thing of the business whereabout I send thee, and
           what I have commanded thee: and I have appointed my servants
           to such and such a place.

09:021:003 Now therefore what is under thine hand? give me five loaves of
           bread in mine hand, or what there is present.

09:021:004 And the priest answered David, and said, There is no common
           bread under mine hand, but there is hallowed bread; if the
           young men have kept themselves at least from women.

09:021:005 And David answered the priest, and said unto him, Of a truth
           women have been kept from us about these three days, since I
           came out, and the vessels of the young men are holy, and the
           bread is in a manner common, yea, though it were sanctified
           this day in the vessel.

09:021:006 So the priest gave him hallowed bread: for there was no bread
           there but the shewbread, that was taken from before the LORD,
           to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away.

09:021:007 Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day,
           detained before the LORD; and his name was Doeg, an Edomite,
           the chiefest of the herdmen that belonged to Saul.

09:021:008 And David said unto Ahimelech, And is there not here under
           thine hand spear or sword? for I have neither brought my sword
           nor my weapons with me, because the king's business required
           haste.

09:021:009 And the priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom
           thou slewest in the valley of Elah, behold, it is here wrapped
           in a cloth behind the ephod: if thou wilt take that, take it:
           for there is no other save that here. And David said, There is
           none like that; give it me.

09:021:010 And David arose and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went
           to Achish the king of Gath.

09:021:011 And the servants of Achish said unto him, Is not this David
           the king of the land? did they not sing one to another of him
           in dances, saying, Saul hath slain his thousands, and David
           his ten thousands?

09:021:012 And David laid up these words in his heart, and was sore
           afraid of Achish the king of Gath.

09:021:013 And he changed his behaviour before them, and feigned himself
           mad in their hands, and scrabbled on the doors of the gate,
           and let his spittle fall down upon his beard.

09:021:014 Then said Achish unto his servants, Lo, ye see the man is mad:
           wherefore then have ye brought him to me?

09:021:015 Have I need of mad men, that ye have brought this fellow to
           play the mad man in my presence? shall this fellow come into
           my house?

09:022:001 David therefore departed thence, and escaped to the cave
           Adullam: and when his brethren and all his father's house
           heard it, they went down thither to him.

09:022:002 And every one that was in distress, and every one that was in
           debt, and every one that was discontented, gathered themselves
           unto him; and he became a captain over them: and there were
           with him about four hundred men.

09:022:003 And David went thence to Mizpeh of Moab: and he said unto the
           king of Moab, Let my father and my mother, I pray thee, come
           forth, and be with you, till I know what God will do for me.

09:022:004 And he brought them before the king of Moab: and they dwelt
           with him all the while that David was in the hold.

09:022:005 And the prophet Gad said unto David, Abide not in the hold;
           depart, and get thee into the land of Judah. Then David
           departed, and came into the forest of Hareth.

09:022:006 When Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men that
           were with him, (now Saul abode in Gibeah under a tree in
           Ramah, having his spear in his hand, and all his servants were
           standing about him;)

09:022:007 Then Saul said unto his servants that stood about him, Hear
           now, ye Benjamites; will the son of Jesse give every one of
           you fields and vineyards, and make you all captains of
           thousands, and captains of hundreds;

09:022:008 That all of you have conspired against me, and there is none
           that sheweth me that my son hath made a league with the son of
           Jesse, and there is none of you that is sorry for me, or
           sheweth unto me that my son hath stirred up my servant against
           me, to lie in wait, as at this day?

09:022:009 Then answered Doeg the Edomite, which was set over the
           servants of Saul, and said, I saw the son of Jesse coming to
           Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub.

09:022:010 And he enquired of the LORD for him, and gave him victuals,
           and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.

09:022:011 Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of
           Ahitub, and all his father's house, the priests that were in
           Nob: and they came all of them to the king.

09:022:012 And Saul said, Hear now, thou son of Ahitub. And he answered,
           Here I am, my lord.

09:022:013 And Saul said unto him, Why have ye conspired against me, thou
           and the son of Jesse, in that thou hast given him bread, and a
           sword, and hast enquired of God for him, that he should rise
           against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?

09:022:014 Then Ahimelech answered the king, and said, And who is so
           faithful among all thy servants as David, which is the king's
           son in law, and goeth at thy bidding, and is honourable in
           thine house?

09:022:015 Did I then begin to enquire of God for him? be it far from me:
           let not the king impute any thing unto his servant, nor to all
           the house of my father: for thy servant knew nothing of all
           this, less or more.

09:022:016 And the king said, Thou shalt surely die, Ahimelech, thou, and
           all thy father's house.

09:022:017 And the king said unto the footmen that stood about him, Turn,
           and slay the priests of the LORD: because their hand also is
           with David, and because they knew when he fled, and did not
           shew it to me. But the servants of the king would not put
           forth their hand to fall upon the priests of the LORD.

09:022:018 And the king said to Doeg, Turn thou, and fall upon the
           priests. And Doeg the Edomite turned, and he fell upon the
           priests, and slew on that day fourscore and five persons that
           did wear a linen ephod.

09:022:019 And Nob, the city of the priests, smote he with the edge of
           the sword, both men and women, children and sucklings, and
           oxen, and asses, and sheep, with the edge of the sword.

09:022:020 And one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named
           Abiathar, escaped, and fled after David.

09:022:021 And Abiathar shewed David that Saul had slain the LORD's
           priests.

09:022:022 And David said unto Abiathar, I knew it that day, when Doeg
           the Edomite was there, that he would surely tell Saul: I have
           occasioned the death of all the persons of thy father's house.

09:022:023 Abide thou with me, fear not: for he that seeketh my life
           seeketh thy life: but with me thou shalt be in safeguard.

09:023:001 Then they told David, saying, Behold, the Philistines fight
           against Keilah, and they rob the threshingfloors.

09:023:002 Therefore David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go and
           smite these Philistines? And the LORD said unto David, Go, and
           smite the Philistines, and save Keilah.

09:023:003 And David's men said unto him, Behold, we be afraid here in
           Judah: how much more then if we come to Keilah against the
           armies of the Philistines?

09:023:004 Then David enquired of the LORD yet again. And the LORD
           answered him and said, Arise, go down to Keilah; for I will
           deliver the Philistines into thine hand.

09:023:005 So David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the
           Philistines, and brought away their cattle, and smote them
           with a great slaughter. So David saved the inhabitants of
           Keilah.

09:023:006 And it came to pass, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled
           to David to Keilah, that he came down with an ephod in his
           hand.

09:023:007 And it was told Saul that David was come to Keilah. And Saul
           said, God hath delivered him into mine hand; for he is shut
           in, by entering into a town that hath gates and bars.

09:023:008 And Saul called all the people together to war, to go down to
           Keilah, to besiege David and his men.

09:023:009 And David knew that Saul secretly practised mischief against
           him; and he said to Abiathar the priest, Bring hither the
           ephod.

09:023:010 Then said David, O LORD God of Israel, thy servant hath
           certainly heard that Saul seeketh to come to Keilah, to
           destroy the city for my sake.

09:023:011 Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? will Saul
           come down, as thy servant hath heard? O LORD God of Israel, I
           beseech thee, tell thy servant. And the LORD said, He will
           come down.

09:023:012 Then said David, Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men
           into the hand of Saul? And the LORD said, They will deliver
           thee up.

09:023:013 Then David and his men, which were about six hundred, arose
           and departed out of Keilah, and went whithersoever they could
           go. And it was told Saul that David was escaped from Keilah;
           and he forbare to go forth.

09:023:014 And David abode in the wilderness in strong holds, and
           remained in a mountain in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul
           sought him every day, but God delivered him not into his hand.

09:023:015 And David saw that Saul was come out to seek his life: and
           David was in the wilderness of Ziph in a wood.

09:023:016 And Jonathan Saul's son arose, and went to David into the
           wood, and strengthened his hand in God.

09:023:017 And he said unto him, Fear not: for the hand of Saul my father
           shall not find thee; and thou shalt be king over Israel, and I
           shall be next unto thee; and that also Saul my father knoweth.

09:023:018 And they two made a covenant before the LORD: and David abode
           in the wood, and Jonathan went to his house.

09:023:019 Then came up the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not
           David hide himself with us in strong holds in the wood, in the
           hill of Hachilah, which is on the south of Jeshimon?

09:023:020 Now therefore, O king, come down according to all the desire
           of thy soul to come down; and our part shall be to deliver him
           into the king's hand.

09:023:021 And Saul said, Blessed be ye of the LORD; for ye have
           compassion on me.

09:023:022 Go, I pray you, prepare yet, and know and see his place where
           his haunt is, and who hath seen him there: for it is told me
           that he dealeth very subtilly.

09:023:023 See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking places
           where he hideth himself, and come ye again to me with the
           certainty, and I will go with you: and it shall come to pass,
           if he be in the land, that I will search him out throughout
           all the thousands of Judah.

09:023:024 And they arose, and went to Ziph before Saul: but David and
           his men were in the wilderness of Maon, in the plain on the
           south of Jeshimon.

09:023:025 Saul also and his men went to seek him. And they told David;
           wherefore he came down into a rock, and abode in the
           wilderness of Maon. And when Saul heard that, he pursued after
           David in the wilderness of Maon.

09:023:026 And Saul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his
           men on that side of the mountain: and David made haste to get
           away for fear of Saul; for Saul and his men compassed David
           and his men round about to take them.

09:023:027 But there came a messenger unto Saul, saying, Haste thee, and
           come; for the Philistines have invaded the land.

09:023:028 Wherefore Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went
           against the Philistines: therefore they called that place
           Selahammahlekoth.

09:023:029 And David went up from thence, and dwelt in strong holds at
           Engedi.

09:024:001 And it came to pass, when Saul was returned from following the
           Philistines, that it was told him, saying, Behold, David is in
           the wilderness of Engedi.

09:024:002 Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel,
           and went to seek David and his men upon the rocks of the wild
           goats.

09:024:003 And he came to the sheepcotes by the way, where was a cave;
           and Saul went in to cover his feet: and David and his men
           remained in the sides of the cave.

09:024:004 And the men of David said unto him, Behold the day of which
           the LORD said unto thee, Behold, I will deliver thine enemy
           into thine hand, that thou mayest do to him as it shall seem
           good unto thee. Then David arose, and cut off the skirt of
           Saul's robe privily.

09:024:005 And it came to pass afterward, that David's heart smote him,
           because he had cut off Saul's skirt.

09:024:006 And he said unto his men, The LORD forbid that I should do
           this thing unto my master, the LORD's anointed, to stretch
           forth mine hand against him, seeing he is the anointed of the
           LORD.

09:024:007 So David stayed his servants with these words, and suffered
           them not to rise against Saul. But Saul rose up out of the
           cave, and went on his way.

09:024:008 David also arose afterward, and went out of the cave, and
           cried after Saul, saying, My lord the king. And when Saul
           looked behind him, David stooped with his face to the earth,
           and bowed himself.

09:024:009 And David said to Saul, Wherefore hearest thou men's words,
           saying, Behold, David seeketh thy hurt?

09:024:010 Behold, this day thine eyes have seen how that the LORD had
           delivered thee to day into mine hand in the cave: and some
           bade me kill thee: but mine eye spared thee; and I said, I
           will not put forth mine hand against my lord; for he is the
           LORD's anointed.

09:024:011 Moreover, my father, see, yea, see the skirt of thy robe in my
           hand: for in that I cut off the skirt of thy robe, and killed
           thee not, know thou and see that there is neither evil nor
           transgression in mine hand, and I have not sinned against
           thee; yet thou huntest my soul to take it.

09:024:012 The LORD judge between me and thee, and the LORD avenge me of
           thee: but mine hand shall not be upon thee.

09:024:013 As saith the proverb of the ancients, Wickedness proceedeth
           from the wicked: but mine hand shall not be upon thee.

09:024:014 After whom is the king of Israel come out? after whom dost
           thou pursue? after a dead dog, after a flea.

09:024:015 The LORD therefore be judge, and judge between me and thee,
           and see, and plead my cause, and deliver me out of thine hand.

09:024:016 And it came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking
           these words unto Saul, that Saul said, Is this thy voice, my
           son David? And Saul lifted up his voice, and wept.

09:024:017 And he said to David, Thou art more righteous than I: for thou
           hast rewarded me good, whereas I have rewarded thee evil.

09:024:018 And thou hast shewed this day how that thou hast dealt well
           with me: forasmuch as when the LORD had delivered me into
           thine hand, thou killedst me not.

09:024:019 For if a man find his enemy, will he let him go well away?
           wherefore the LORD reward thee good for that thou hast done
           unto me this day.

09:024:020 And now, behold, I know well that thou shalt surely be king,
           and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in thine
           hand.

09:024:021 Swear now therefore unto me by the LORD, that thou wilt not
           cut off my seed after me, and that thou wilt not destroy my
           name out of my father's house.

09:024:022 And David sware unto Saul. And Saul went home; but David and
           his men gat them up unto the hold.

09:025:001 And Samuel died; and all the Israelites were gathered
           together, and lamented him, and buried him in his house at
           Ramah. And David arose, and went down to the wilderness of
           Paran.

09:025:002 And there was a man in Maon, whose possessions were in Carmel;
           and the man was very great, and he had three thousand sheep,
           and a thousand goats: and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel.

09:025:003 Now the name of the man was Nabal; and the name of his wife
           Abigail: and she was a woman of good understanding, and of a
           beautiful countenance: but the man was churlish and evil in
           his doings; and he was of the house of Caleb.

09:025:004 And David heard in the wilderness that Nabal did shear his
           sheep.

09:025:005 And David sent out ten young men, and David said unto the
           young men, Get you up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet
           him in my name:

09:025:006 And thus shall ye say to him that liveth in prosperity, Peace
           be both to thee, and peace be to thine house, and peace be
           unto all that thou hast.

09:025:007 And now I have heard that thou hast shearers: now thy
           shepherds which were with us, we hurt them not, neither was
           there ought missing unto them, all the while they were in
           Carmel.

09:025:008 Ask thy young men, and they will shew thee. Wherefore let the
           young men find favour in thine eyes: for we come in a good
           day: give, I pray thee, whatsoever cometh to thine hand unto
           thy servants, and to thy son David.

09:025:009 And when David's young men came, they spake to Nabal according
           to all those words in the name of David, and ceased.

09:025:010 And Nabal answered David's servants, and said, Who is David?
           and who is the son of Jesse? there be many servants now a days
           that break away every man from his master.

09:025:011 Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my flesh that I
           have killed for my shearers, and give it unto men, whom I know
           not whence they be?

09:025:012 So David's young men turned their way, and went again, and
           came and told him all those sayings.

09:025:013 And David said unto his men, Gird ye on every man his sword.
           And they girded on every man his sword; and David also girded
           on his sword: and there went up after David about four hundred
           men; and two hundred abode by the stuff.

09:025:014 But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal's wife, saying,
           Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute
           our master; and he railed on them.

09:025:015 But the men were very good unto us, and we were not hurt,
           neither missed we any thing, as long as we were conversant
           with them, when we were in the fields:

09:025:016 They were a wall unto us both by night and day, all the while
           we were with them keeping the sheep.

09:025:017 Now therefore know and consider what thou wilt do; for evil is
           determined against our master, and against all his household:
           for he is such a son of Belial, that a man cannot speak to
           him.

09:025:018 Then Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and two
           bottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five
           measures of parched corn, and an hundred clusters of raisins,
           and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid them on asses.

09:025:019 And she said unto her servants, Go on before me; behold, I
           come after you. But she told not her husband Nabal.

09:025:020 And it was so, as she rode on the ass, that she came down by
           the covert on the hill, and, behold, David and his men came
           down against her; and she met them.

09:025:021 Now David had said, Surely in vain have I kept all that this
           fellow hath in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of
           all that pertained unto him: and he hath requited me evil for
           good.

09:025:022 So and more also do God unto the enemies of David, if I leave
           of all that pertain to him by the morning light any that
           pisseth against the wall.

09:025:023 And when Abigail saw David, she hasted, and lighted off the
           ass, and fell before David on her face, and bowed herself to
           the ground,

09:025:024 And fell at his feet, and said, Upon me, my lord, upon me let
           this iniquity be: and let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak
           in thine audience, and hear the words of thine handmaid.

09:025:025 Let not my lord, I pray thee, regard this man of Belial, even
           Nabal: for as his name is, so is he; Nabal is his name, and
           folly is with him: but I thine handmaid saw not the young men
           of my lord, whom thou didst send.

09:025:026 Now therefore, my lord, as the LORD liveth, and as thy soul
           liveth, seeing the LORD hath withholden thee from coming to
           shed blood, and from avenging thyself with thine own hand, now
           let thine enemies, and they that seek evil to my lord, be as
           Nabal.

09:025:027 And now this blessing which thine handmaid hath brought unto
           my lord, let it even be given unto the young men that follow
           my lord.

09:025:028 I pray thee, forgive the trespass of thine handmaid: for the
           LORD will certainly make my lord a sure house; because my lord
           fighteth the battles of the LORD, and evil hath not been found
           in thee all thy days.

09:025:029 Yet a man is risen to pursue thee, and to seek thy soul: but
           the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with
           the LORD thy God; and the souls of thine enemies, them shall
           he sling out, as out of the middle of a sling.

09:025:030 And it shall come to pass, when the LORD shall have done to my
           lord according to all the good that he hath spoken concerning
           thee, and shall have appointed thee ruler over Israel;

09:025:031 That this shall be no grief unto thee, nor offence of heart
           unto my lord, either that thou hast shed blood causeless, or
           that my lord hath avenged himself: but when the LORD shall
           have dealt well with my lord, then remember thine handmaid.

09:025:032 And David said to Abigail, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel,
           which sent thee this day to meet me:

09:025:033 And blessed be thy advice, and blessed be thou, which hast
           kept me this day from coming to shed blood, and from avenging
           myself with mine own hand.

09:025:034 For in very deed, as the LORD God of Israel liveth, which hath
           kept me back from hurting thee, except thou hadst hasted and
           come to meet me, surely there had not been left unto Nabal by
           the morning light any that pisseth against the wall.

09:025:035 So David received of her hand that which she had brought him,
           and said unto her, Go up in peace to thine house; see, I have
           hearkened to thy voice, and have accepted thy person.

09:025:036 And Abigail came to Nabal; and, behold, he held a feast in his
           house, like the feast of a king; and Nabal's heart was merry
           within him, for he was very drunken: wherefore she told him
           nothing, less or more, until the morning light.

09:025:037 But it came to pass in the morning, when the wine was gone out
           of Nabal, and his wife had told him these things, that his
           heart died within him, and he became as a stone.

09:025:038 And it came to pass about ten days after, that the LORD smote
           Nabal, that he died.

09:025:039 And when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed be
           the LORD, that hath pleaded the cause of my reproach from the
           hand of Nabal, and hath kept his servant from evil: for the
           LORD hath returned the wickedness of Nabal upon his own head.
           And David sent and communed with Abigail, to take her to him
           to wife.

09:025:040 And when the servants of David were come to Abigail to Carmel,
           they spake unto her, saying, David sent us unto thee, to take
           thee to him to wife.

09:025:041 And she arose, and bowed herself on her face to the earth, and
           said, Behold, let thine handmaid be a servant to wash the feet
           of the servants of my lord.

09:025:042 And Abigail hasted, and arose and rode upon an ass, with five
           damsels of hers that went after her; and she went after the
           messengers of David, and became his wife.

09:025:043 David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel; and they were also both of
           them his wives.

09:025:044 But Saul had given Michal his daughter, David's wife, to
           Phalti the son of Laish, which was of Gallim.

09:026:001 And the Ziphites came unto Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not
           David hide himself in the hill of Hachilah, which is before
           Jeshimon?

09:026:002 Then Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph,
           having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek
           David in the wilderness of Ziph.

09:026:003 And Saul pitched in the hill of Hachilah, which is before
           Jeshimon, by the way. But David abode in the wilderness, and
           he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness.

09:026:004 David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul was
           come in very deed.

09:026:005 And David arose, and came to the place where Saul had pitched:
           and David beheld the place where Saul lay, and Abner the son
           of Ner, the captain of his host: and Saul lay in the trench,
           and the people pitched round about him.

09:026:006 Then answered David and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to
           Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab, saying, Who will
           go down with me to Saul to the camp? And Abishai said, I will
           go down with thee.

09:026:007 So David and Abishai came to the people by night: and, behold,
           Saul lay sleeping within the trench, and his spear stuck in
           the ground at his bolster: but Abner and the people lay round
           about him.

09:026:008 Then said Abishai to David, God hath delivered thine enemy
           into thine hand this day: now therefore let me smite him, I
           pray thee, with the spear even to the earth at once, and I
           will not smite him the second time.

09:026:009 And David said to Abishai, Destroy him not: for who can
           stretch forth his hand against the LORD's anointed, and be
           guiltless?

09:026:010 David said furthermore, As the LORD liveth, the LORD shall
           smite him; or his day shall come to die; or he shall descend
           into battle, and perish.

09:026:011 The LORD forbid that I should stretch forth mine hand against
           the LORD's anointed: but, I pray thee, take thou now the spear
           that is at his bolster, and the cruse of water, and let us go.

09:026:012 So David took the spear and the cruse of water from Saul's
           bolster; and they gat them away, and no man saw it, nor knew
           it, neither awaked: for they were all asleep; because a deep
           sleep from the LORD was fallen upon them.

09:026:013 Then David went over to the other side, and stood on the top
           of an hill afar off; a great space being between them:

09:026:014 And David cried to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner,
           saying, Answerest thou not, Abner? Then Abner answered and
           said, Who art thou that criest to the king?

09:026:015 And David said to Abner, Art not thou a valiant man? and who
           is like to thee in Israel? wherefore then hast thou not kept
           thy lord the king? for there came one of the people in to
           destroy the king thy lord.

09:026:016 This thing is not good that thou hast done. As the LORD
           liveth, ye are worthy to die, because ye have not kept your
           master, the LORD's anointed. And now see where the king's
           spear is, and the cruse of water that was at his bolster.

09:026:017 And Saul knew David's voice, and said, Is this thy voice, my
           son David? And David said, It is my voice, my lord, O king.

09:026:018 And he said, Wherefore doth my lord thus pursue after his
           servant? for what have I done? or what evil is in mine hand?

09:026:019 Now therefore, I pray thee, let my lord the king hear the
           words of his servant. If the LORD have stirred thee up against
           me, let him accept an offering: but if they be the children of
           men, cursed be they before the LORD; for they have driven me
           out this day from abiding in the inheritance of the LORD,
           saying, Go, serve other gods.

09:026:020 Now therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth before the
           face of the LORD: for the king of Israel is come out to seek a
           flea, as when one doth hunt a partridge in the mountains.

09:026:021 Then said Saul, I have sinned: return, my son David: for I
           will no more do thee harm, because my soul was precious in
           thine eyes this day: behold, I have played the fool, and have
           erred exceedingly.

09:026:022 And David answered and said, Behold the king's spear! and let
           one of the young men come over and fetch it.

09:026:023 The LORD render to every man his righteousness and his
           faithfulness; for the LORD delivered thee into my hand to day,
           but I would not stretch forth mine hand against the LORD's
           anointed.

09:026:024 And, behold, as thy life was much set by this day in mine
           eyes, so let my life be much set by in the eyes of the LORD,
           and let him deliver me out of all tribulation.

09:026:025 Then Saul said to David, Blessed be thou, my son David: thou
           shalt both do great things, and also shalt still prevail. So
           David went on his way, and Saul returned to his place.

09:027:001 And David said in his heart, I shall now perish one day by the
           hand of Saul: there is nothing better for me than that I
           should speedily escape into the land of the Philistines; and
           Saul shall despair of me, to seek me any more in any coast of
           Israel: so shall I escape out of his hand.

09:027:002 And David arose, and he passed over with the six hundred men
           that were with him unto Achish, the son of Maoch, king of
           Gath.

09:027:003 And David dwelt with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man
           with his household, even David with his two wives, Ahinoam the
           Jezreelitess, and Abigail the Carmelitess, Nabal's wife.

09:027:004 And it was told Saul that David was fled to Gath: and he
           sought no more again for him.

09:027:005 And David said unto Achish, If I have now found grace in thine
           eyes, let them give me a place in some town in the country,
           that I may dwell there: for why should thy servant dwell in
           the royal city with thee?

09:027:006 Then Achish gave him Ziklag that day: wherefore Ziklag
           pertaineth unto the kings of Judah unto this day.

09:027:007 And the time that David dwelt in the country of the
           Philistines was a full year and four months.

09:027:008 And David and his men went up, and invaded the Geshurites, and
           the Gezrites, and the Amalekites: for those nations were of
           old the inhabitants of the land, as thou goest to Shur, even
           unto the land of Egypt.

09:027:009 And David smote the land, and left neither man nor woman
           alive, and took away the sheep, and the oxen, and the asses,
           and the camels, and the apparel, and returned, and came to
           Achish.

09:027:010 And Achish said, Whither have ye made a road to day? And David
           said, Against the south of Judah, and against the south of the
           Jerahmeelites, and against the south of the Kenites.

09:027:011 And David saved neither man nor woman alive, to bring tidings
           to Gath, saying, Lest they should tell on us, saying, So did
           David, and so will be his manner all the while he dwelleth in
           the country of the Philistines.

09:027:012 And Achish believed David, saying, He hath made his people
           Israel utterly to abhor him; therefore he shall be my servant
           for ever.

09:028:001 And it came to pass in those days, that the Philistines
           gathered their armies together for warfare, to fight with
           Israel. And Achish said unto David, Know thou assuredly, that
           thou shalt go out with me to battle, thou and thy men.

09:028:002 And David said to Achish, Surely thou shalt know what thy
           servant can do. And Achish said to David, Therefore will I
           make thee keeper of mine head for ever.

09:028:003 Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him, and
           buried him in Ramah, even in his own city. And Saul had put
           away those that had familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of
           the land.

09:028:004 And the Philistines gathered themselves together, and came and
           pitched in Shunem: and Saul gathered all Israel together, and
           they pitched in Gilboa.

09:028:005 And when Saul saw the host of the Philistines, he was afraid,
           and his heart greatly trembled.

09:028:006 And when Saul enquired of the LORD, the LORD answered him not,
           neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets.

09:028:007 Then said Saul unto his servants, Seek me a woman that hath a
           familiar spirit, that I may go to her, and enquire of her. And
           his servants said to him, Behold, there is a woman that hath a
           familiar spirit at Endor.

09:028:008 And Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and he
           went, and two men with him, and they came to the woman by
           night: and he said, I pray thee, divine unto me by the
           familiar spirit, and bring me him up, whom I shall name unto
           thee.

09:028:009 And the woman said unto him, Behold, thou knowest what Saul
           hath done, how he hath cut off those that have familiar
           spirits, and the wizards, out of the land: wherefore then
           layest thou a snare for my life, to cause me to die?

09:028:010 And Saul sware to her by the LORD, saying, As the LORD liveth,
           there shall no punishment happen to thee for this thing.

09:028:011 Then said the woman, Whom shall I bring up unto thee? And he
           said, Bring me up Samuel.

09:028:012 And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice:
           and the woman spake to Saul, saying, Why hast thou deceived
           me? for thou art Saul.

09:028:013 And the king said unto her, Be not afraid: for what sawest
           thou? And the woman said unto Saul, I saw gods ascending out
           of the earth.

09:028:014 And he said unto her, What form is he of? And she said, An old
           man cometh up; and he is covered with a mantle. And Saul
           perceived that it was Samuel, and he stooped with his face to
           the ground, and bowed himself.

09:028:015 And Samuel said to Saul, Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring
           me up? And Saul answered, I am sore distressed; for the
           Philistines make war against me, and God is departed from me,
           and answereth me no more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams:
           therefore I have called thee, that thou mayest make known unto
           me what I shall do.

09:028:016 Then said Samuel, Wherefore then dost thou ask of me, seeing
           the LORD is departed from thee, and is become thine enemy?

09:028:017 And the LORD hath done to him, as he spake by me: for the LORD
           hath rent the kingdom out of thine hand, and given it to thy
           neighbour, even to David:

09:028:018 Because thou obeyedst not the voice of the LORD, nor
           executedst his fierce wrath upon Amalek, therefore hath the
           LORD done this thing unto thee this day.

09:028:019 Moreover the LORD will also deliver Israel with thee into the
           hand of the Philistines: and to morrow shalt thou and thy sons
           be with me: the LORD also shall deliver the host of Israel
           into the hand of the Philistines.

09:028:020 Then Saul fell straightway all along on the earth, and was
           sore afraid, because of the words of Samuel: and there was no
           strength in him; for he had eaten no bread all the day, nor
           all the night.

09:028:021 And the woman came unto Saul, and saw that he was sore
           troubled, and said unto him, Behold, thine handmaid hath
           obeyed thy voice, and I have put my life in my hand, and have
           hearkened unto thy words which thou spakest unto me.

09:028:022 Now therefore, I pray thee, hearken thou also unto the voice
           of thine handmaid, and let me set a morsel of bread before
           thee; and eat, that thou mayest have strength, when thou goest
           on thy way.

09:028:023 But he refused, and said, I will not eat. But his servants,
           together with the woman, compelled him; and he hearkened unto
           their voice. So he arose from the earth, and sat upon the bed.

09:028:024 And the woman had a fat calf in the house; and she hasted, and
           killed it, and took flour, and kneaded it, and did bake
           unleavened bread thereof:

09:028:025 And she brought it before Saul, and before his servants; and
           they did eat. Then they rose up, and went away that night.

09:029:001 Now the Philistines gathered together all their armies to
           Aphek: and the Israelites pitched by a fountain which is in
           Jezreel.

09:029:002 And the lords of the Philistines passed on by hundreds, and by
           thousands: but David and his men passed on in the rereward
           with Achish.

09:029:003 Then said the princes of the Philistines, What do these
           Hebrews here? And Achish said unto the princes of the
           Philistines, Is not this David, the servant of Saul the king
           of Israel, which hath been with me these days, or these years,
           and I have found no fault in him since he fell unto me unto
           this day?

09:029:004 And the princes of the Philistines were wroth with him; and
           the princes of the Philistines said unto him, Make this fellow
           return, that he may go again to his place which thou hast
           appointed him, and let him not go down with us to battle, lest
           in the battle he be an adversary to us: for wherewith should
           he reconcile himself unto his master? should it not be with
           the heads of these men?

09:029:005 Is not this David, of whom they sang one to another in dances,
           saying, Saul slew his thousands, and David his ten thousands?

09:029:006 Then Achish called David, and said unto him, Surely, as the
           LORD liveth, thou hast been upright, and thy going out and thy
           coming in with me in the host is good in my sight: for I have
           not found evil in thee since the day of thy coming unto me
           unto this day: nevertheless the lords favour thee not.

09:029:007 Wherefore now return, and go in peace, that thou displease not
           the lords of the Philistines.

09:029:008 And David said unto Achish, But what have I done? and what
           hast thou found in thy servant so long as I have been with
           thee unto this day, that I may not go fight against the
           enemies of my lord the king?

09:029:009 And Achish answered and said to David, I know that thou art
           good in my sight, as an angel of God: notwithstanding the
           princes of the Philistines have said, He shall not go up with
           us to the battle.

09:029:010 Wherefore now rise up early in the morning with thy master's
           servants that are come with thee: and as soon as ye be up
           early in the morning, and have light, depart.

09:029:011 So David and his men rose up early to depart in the morning,
           to return into the land of the Philistines. And the
           Philistines went up to Jezreel.

09:030:001 And it came to pass, when David and his men were come to
           Ziklag on the third day, that the Amalekites had invaded the
           south, and Ziklag, and smitten Ziklag, and burned it with
           fire;

09:030:002 And had taken the women captives, that were therein: they slew
           not any, either great or small, but carried them away, and
           went on their way.

09:030:003 So David and his men came to the city, and, behold, it was
           burned with fire; and their wives, and their sons, and their
           daughters, were taken captives.

09:030:004 Then David and the people that were with him lifted up their
           voice and wept, until they had no more power to weep.

09:030:005 And David's two wives were taken captives, Ahinoam the
           Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.

09:030:006 And David was greatly distressed; for the people spake of
           stoning him, because the soul of all the people was grieved,
           every man for his sons and for his daughters: but David
           encouraged himself in the LORD his God.

09:030:007 And David said to Abiathar the priest, Ahimelech's son, I pray
           thee, bring me hither the ephod. And Abiathar brought thither
           the ephod to David.

09:030:008 And David enquired at the LORD, saying, Shall I pursue after
           this troop? shall I overtake them? And he answered him,
           Pursue: for thou shalt surely overtake them, and without fail
           recover all.

09:030:009 So David went, he and the six hundred men that were with him,
           and came to the brook Besor, where those that were left behind
           stayed.

09:030:010 But David pursued, he and four hundred men: for two hundred
           abode behind, which were so faint that they could not go over
           the brook Besor.

09:030:011 And they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to
           David, and gave him bread, and he did eat; and they made him
           drink water;

09:030:012 And they gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and two clusters
           of raisins: and when he had eaten, his spirit came again to
           him: for he had eaten no bread, nor drunk any water, three
           days and three nights.

09:030:013 And David said unto him, To whom belongest thou? and whence
           art thou? And he said, I am a young man of Egypt, servant to
           an Amalekite; and my master left me, because three days agone
           I fell sick.

09:030:014 We made an invasion upon the south of the Cherethites, and
           upon the coast which belongeth to Judah, and upon the south of
           Caleb; and we burned Ziklag with fire.

09:030:015 And David said to him, Canst thou bring me down to this
           company? And he said, Swear unto me by God, that thou wilt
           neither kill me, nor deliver me into the hands of my master,
           and I will bring thee down to this company.

09:030:016 And when he had brought him down, behold, they were spread
           abroad upon all the earth, eating and drinking, and dancing,
           because of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the
           land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Judah.

09:030:017 And David smote them from the twilight even unto the evening
           of the next day: and there escaped not a man of them, save
           four hundred young men, which rode upon camels, and fled.

09:030:018 And David recovered all that the Amalekites had carried away:
           and David rescued his two wives.

09:030:019 And there was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor
           great, neither sons nor daughters, neither spoil, nor any
           thing that they had taken to them: David recovered all.

09:030:020 And David took all the flocks and the herds, which they drave
           before those other cattle, and said, This is David's spoil.

09:030:021 And David came to the two hundred men, which were so faint
           that they could not follow David, whom they had made also to
           abide at the brook Besor: and they went forth to meet David,
           and to meet the people that were with him: and when David came
           near to the people, he saluted them.

09:030:022 Then answered all the wicked men and men of Belial, of those
           that went with David, and said, Because they went not with us,
           we will not give them ought of the spoil that we have
           recovered, save to every man his wife and his children, that
           they may lead them away, and depart.

09:030:023 Then said David, Ye shall not do so, my brethren, with that
           which the LORD hath given us, who hath preserved us, and
           delivered the company that came against us into our hand.

09:030:024 For who will hearken unto you in this matter? but as his part
           is that goeth down to the battle, so shall his part be that
           tarrieth by the stuff: they shall part alike.

09:030:025 And it was so from that day forward, that he made it a statute
           and an ordinance for Israel unto this day.

09:030:026 And when David came to Ziklag, he sent of the spoil unto the
           elders of Judah, even to his friends, saying, Behold a present
           for you of the spoil of the enemies of the LORD;

09:030:027 To them which were in Bethel, and to them which were in south
           Ramoth, and to them which were in Jattir,

09:030:028 And to them which were in Aroer, and to them which were in
           Siphmoth, and to them which were in Eshtemoa,

09:030:029 And to them which were in Rachal, and to them which were in
           the cities of the Jerahmeelites, and to them which were in the
           cities of the Kenites,

09:030:030 And to them which were in Hormah, and to them which were in
           Chorashan, and to them which were in Athach,

09:030:031 And to them which were in Hebron, and to all the places where
           David himself and his men were wont to haunt.

09:031:001 Now the Philistines fought against Israel: and the men of
           Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain
           in mount Gilboa.

09:031:002 And the Philistines followed hard upon Saul and upon his sons;
           and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and
           Melchishua, Saul's sons.

09:031:003 And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit
           him; and he was sore wounded of the archers.

09:031:004 Then said Saul unto his armourbearer, Draw thy sword, and
           thrust me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and
           thrust me through, and abuse me. But his armourbearer would
           not; for he was sore afraid. Therefore Saul took a sword, and
           fell upon it.

09:031:005 And when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell
           likewise upon his sword, and died with him.

09:031:006 So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armourbearer, and
           all his men, that same day together.

09:031:007 And when the men of Israel that were on the other side of the
           valley, and they that were on the other side Jordan, saw that
           the men of Israel fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead,
           they forsook the cities, and fled; and the Philistines came
           and dwelt in them.

09:031:008 And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came
           to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his three sons
           fallen in mount Gilboa.

09:031:009 And they cut off his head, and stripped off his armour, and
           sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to publish
           it in the house of their idols, and among the people.

09:031:010 And they put his armour in the house of Ashtaroth: and they
           fastened his body to the wall of Bethshan.

09:031:011 And when the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead heard of that which
           the Philistines had done to Saul;

09:031:012 All the valiant men arose, and went all night, and took the
           body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of
           Bethshan, and came to Jabesh, and burnt them there.

09:031:013 And they took their bones, and buried them under a tree at
           Jabesh, and fasted seven days.

Book 10        2 Samuel

10:001:001 Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was
           returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had
           abode two days in Ziklag;

10:001:002 It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man
           came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and
           earth upon his head: and so it was, when he came to David,
           that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance.

10:001:003 And David said unto him, From whence comest thou? And he said
           unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.

10:001:004 And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee,
           tell me. And he answered, That the people are fled from the
           battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and
           Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.

10:001:005 And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest
           thou that Saul and Jonathan his son be dead?

10:001:006 And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance
           upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and,
           lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.

10:001:007 And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me.
           And I answered, Here am I.

10:001:008 And he said unto me, Who art thou? And I answered him, I am an
           Amalekite.

10:001:009 He said unto me again, Stand, I pray thee, upon me, and slay
           me: for anguish is come upon me, because my life is yet whole
           in me.

10:001:010 So I stood upon him, and slew him, because I was sure that he
           could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown
           that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm,
           and have brought them hither unto my lord.

10:001:011 Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and
           likewise all the men that were with him:

10:001:012 And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul,
           and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the LORD, and
           for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the
           sword.

10:001:013 And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence art
           thou? And he answered, I am the son of a stranger, an
           Amalekite.

10:001:014 And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to stretch
           forth thine hand to destroy the LORD's anointed?

10:001:015 And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, and
           fall upon him. And he smote him that he died.

10:001:016 And David said unto him, Thy blood be upon thy head; for thy
           mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain the
           LORD's anointed.

10:001:017 And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over
           Jonathan his son:

10:001:018 (Also he bade them teach the children of Judah the use of the
           bow: behold, it is written in the book of Jasher.)

10:001:019 The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places: how are
           the mighty fallen!

10:001:020 Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Askelon;
           lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the
           daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.

10:001:021 Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, neither let there
           be rain, upon you, nor fields of offerings: for there the
           shield of the mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul,
           as though he had not been anointed with oil.

10:001:022 From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the
           bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul
           returned not empty.

10:001:023 Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and
           in their death they were not divided: they were swifter than
           eagles, they were stronger than lions.

10:001:024 Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in
           scarlet, with other delights, who put on ornaments of gold
           upon your apparel.

10:001:025 How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O
           Jonathan, thou wast slain in thine high places.

10:001:026 I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant
           hast thou been unto me: thy love to me was wonderful, passing
           the love of women.

10:001:027 How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!

10:002:001 And it came to pass after this, that David enquired of the
           LORD, saying, Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah?
           And the LORD said unto him, Go up. And David said, Whither
           shall I go up? And he said, Unto Hebron.

10:002:002 So David went up thither, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the
           Jezreelitess, and Abigail Nabal's wife the Carmelite.

10:002:003 And his men that were with him did David bring up, every man
           with his household: and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron.

10:002:004 And the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king
           over the house of Judah. And they told David, saying, That the
           men of Jabeshgilead were they that buried Saul.

10:002:005 And David sent messengers unto the men of Jabeshgilead, and
           said unto them, Blessed be ye of the LORD, that ye have shewed
           this kindness unto your lord, even unto Saul, and have buried
           him.

10:002:006 And now the LORD shew kindness and truth unto you: and I also
           will requite you this kindness, because ye have done this
           thing.

10:002:007 Therefore now let your hands be strengthened, and be ye
           valiant: for your master Saul is dead, and also the house of
           Judah have anointed me king over them.

10:002:008 But Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul's host, took
           Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim;

10:002:009 And made him king over Gilead, and over the Ashurites, and
           over Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over
           all Israel.

10:002:010 Ishbosheth Saul's son was forty years old when he began to
           reign over Israel, and reigned two years. But the house of
           Judah followed David.

10:002:011 And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of
           Judah was seven years and six months.

10:002:012 And Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ishbosheth the
           son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.

10:002:013 And Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went
           out, and met together by the pool of Gibeon: and they sat
           down, the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on
           the other side of the pool.

10:002:014 And Abner said to Joab, Let the young men now arise, and play
           before us. And Joab said, Let them arise.

10:002:015 Then there arose and went over by number twelve of Benjamin,
           which pertained to Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of
           the servants of David.

10:002:016 And they caught every one his fellow by the head, and thrust
           his sword in his fellow's side; so they fell down together:
           wherefore that place was called Helkathhazzurim, which is in
           Gibeon.

10:002:017 And there was a very sore battle that day; and Abner was
           beaten, and the men of Israel, before the servants of David.

10:002:018 And there were three sons of Zeruiah there, Joab, and Abishai,
           and Asahel: and Asahel was as light of foot as a wild roe.

10:002:019 And Asahel pursued after Abner; and in going he turned not to
           the right hand nor to the left from following Abner.

10:002:020 Then Abner looked behind him, and said, Art thou Asahel? And
           he answered, I am.

10:002:021 And Abner said to him, Turn thee aside to thy right hand or to
           thy left, and lay thee hold on one of the young men, and take
           thee his armour. But Asahel would not turn aside from
           following of him.

10:002:022 And Abner said again to Asahel, Turn thee aside from following
           me: wherefore should I smite thee to the ground? how then
           should I hold up my face to Joab thy brother?

10:002:023 Howbeit he refused to turn aside: wherefore Abner with the
           hinder end of the spear smote him under the fifth rib, that
           the spear came out behind him; and he fell down there, and
           died in the same place: and it came to pass, that as many as
           came to the place where Asahel fell down and died stood still.

10:002:024 Joab also and Abishai pursued after Abner: and the sun went
           down when they were come to the hill of Ammah, that lieth
           before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon.

10:002:025 And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together
           after Abner, and became one troop, and stood on the top of an
           hill.

10:002:026 Then Abner called to Joab, and said, Shall the sword devour
           for ever? knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the
           latter end? how long shall it be then, ere thou bid the people
           return from following their brethren?

10:002:027 And Joab said, As God liveth, unless thou hadst spoken, surely
           then in the morning the people had gone up every one from
           following his brother.

10:002:028 So Joab blew a trumpet, and all the people stood still, and
           pursued after Israel no more, neither fought they any more.

10:002:029 And Abner and his men walked all that night through the plain,
           and passed over Jordan, and went through all Bithron, and they
           came to Mahanaim.

10:002:030 And Joab returned from following Abner: and when he had
           gathered all the people together, there lacked of David's
           servants nineteen men and Asahel.

10:002:031 But the servants of David had smitten of Benjamin, and of
           Abner's men, so that three hundred and threescore men died.

10:002:032 And they took up Asahel, and buried him in the sepulchre of
           his father, which was in Bethlehem. And Joab and his men went
           all night, and they came to Hebron at break of day.

10:003:001 Now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house
           of David: but David waxed stronger and stronger, and the house
           of Saul waxed weaker and weaker.

10:003:002 And unto David were sons born in Hebron: and his firstborn was
           Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess;

10:003:003 And his second, Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the
           Carmelite; and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah the
           daughter of Talmai king of Geshur;

10:003:004 And the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth,
           Shephatiah the son of Abital;

10:003:005 And the sixth, Ithream, by Eglah David's wife. These were born
           to David in Hebron.

10:003:006 And it came to pass, while there was war between the house of
           Saul and the house of David, that Abner made himself strong
           for the house of Saul.

10:003:007 And Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter
           of Aiah: and Ishbosheth said to Abner, Wherefore hast thou
           gone in unto my father's concubine?

10:003:008 Then was Abner very wroth for the words of Ishbosheth, and
           said, Am I a dog's head, which against Judah do shew kindness
           this day unto the house of Saul thy father, to his brethren,
           and to his friends, and have not delivered thee into the hand
           of David, that thou chargest me to day with a fault concerning
           this woman?

10:003:009 So do God to Abner, and more also, except, as the LORD hath
           sworn to David, even so I do to him;

10:003:010 To translate the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set up
           the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even
           to Beersheba.

10:003:011 And he could not answer Abner a word again, because he feared
           him.

10:003:012 And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying,
           Whose is the land? saying also, Make thy league with me, and,
           behold, my hand shall be with thee, to bring about all Israel
           unto thee.

10:003:013 And he said, Well; I will make a league with thee: but one
           thing I require of thee, that is, Thou shalt not see my face,
           except thou first bring Michal Saul's daughter, when thou
           comest to see my face.

10:003:014 And David sent messengers to Ishbosheth Saul's son, saying,
           Deliver me my wife Michal, which I espoused to me for an
           hundred foreskins of the Philistines.

10:003:015 And Ishbosheth sent, and took her from her husband, even from
           Phaltiel the son of Laish.

10:003:016 And her husband went with her along weeping behind her to
           Bahurim. Then said Abner unto him, Go, return. And he
           returned.

10:003:017 And Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying,
           Ye sought for David in times past to be king over you:

10:003:018 Now then do it: for the LORD hath spoken of David, saying, By
           the hand of my servant David I will save my people Israel out
           of the hand of the Philistines, and out of the hand of all
           their enemies.

10:003:019 And Abner also spake in the ears of Benjamin: and Abner went
           also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed
           good to Israel, and that seemed good to the whole house of
           Benjamin.

10:003:020 So Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him. And
           David made Abner and the men that were with him a feast.

10:003:021 And Abner said unto David, I will arise and go, and will
           gather all Israel unto my lord the king, that they may make a
           league with thee, and that thou mayest reign over all that
           thine heart desireth. And David sent Abner away; and he went
           in peace.

10:003:022 And, behold, the servants of David and Joab came from pursuing
           a troop, and brought in a great spoil with them: but Abner was
           not with David in Hebron; for he had sent him away, and he was
           gone in peace.

10:003:023 When Joab and all the host that was with him were come, they
           told Joab, saying, Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and
           he hath sent him away, and he is gone in peace.

10:003:024 Then Joab came to the king, and said, What hast thou done?
           behold, Abner came unto thee; why is it that thou hast sent
           him away, and he is quite gone?

10:003:025 Thou knowest Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive
           thee, and to know thy going out and thy coming in, and to know
           all that thou doest.

10:003:026 And when Joab was come out from David, he sent messengers
           after Abner, which brought him again from the well of Sirah:
           but David knew it not.

10:003:027 And when Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside in
           the gate to speak with him quietly, and smote him there under
           the fifth rib, that he died, for the blood of Asahel his
           brother.

10:003:028 And afterward when David heard it, he said, I and my kingdom
           are guiltless before the LORD for ever from the blood of Abner
           the son of Ner:

10:003:029 Let it rest on the head of Joab, and on all his father's
           house; and let there not fail from the house of Joab one that
           hath an issue, or that is a leper, or that leaneth on a staff,
           or that falleth on the sword, or that lacketh bread.

10:003:030 So Joab, and Abishai his brother slew Abner, because he had
           slain their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle.

10:003:031 And David said to Joab, and to all the people that were with
           him, Rend your clothes, and gird you with sackcloth, and mourn
           before Abner. And king David himself followed the bier.

10:003:032 And they buried Abner in Hebron: and the king lifted up his
           voice, and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people
           wept.

10:003:033 And the king lamented over Abner, and said, Died Abner as a
           fool dieth?

10:003:034 Thy hands were not bound, nor thy feet put into fetters: as a
           man falleth before wicked men, so fellest thou. And all the
           people wept again over him.

10:003:035 And when all the people came to cause David to eat meat while
           it was yet day, David sware, saying, So do God to me, and more
           also, if I taste bread, or ought else, till the sun be down.

10:003:036 And all the people took notice of it, and it pleased them: as
           whatsoever the king did pleased all the people.

10:003:037 For all the people and all Israel understood that day that it
           was not of the king to slay Abner the son of Ner.

10:003:038 And the king said unto his servants, Know ye not that there is
           a prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel?

10:003:039 And I am this day weak, though anointed king; and these men
           the sons of Zeruiah be too hard for me: the LORD shall reward
           the doer of evil according to his wickedness.

10:004:001 And when Saul's son heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, his
           hands were feeble, and all the Israelites were troubled.

10:004:002 And Saul's son had two men that were captains of bands: the
           name of the one was Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab,
           the sons of Rimmon a Beerothite, of the children of Benjamin:
           (for Beeroth also was reckoned to Benjamin.

10:004:003 And the Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and were sojourners there
           until this day.)

10:004:004 And Jonathan, Saul's son, had a son that was lame of his feet.
           He was five years old when the tidings came of Saul and
           Jonathan out of Jezreel, and his nurse took him up, and fled:
           and it came to pass, as she made haste to flee, that he fell,
           and became lame. And his name was Mephibosheth.

10:004:005 And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah,
           went, and came about the heat of the day to the house of
           Ishbosheth, who lay on a bed at noon.

10:004:006 And they came thither into the midst of the house, as though
           they would have fetched wheat; and they smote him under the
           fifth rib: and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped.

10:004:007 For when they came into the house, he lay on his bed in his
           bedchamber, and they smote him, and slew him, and beheaded
           him, and took his head, and gat them away through the plain
           all night.

10:004:008 And they brought the head of Ishbosheth unto David to Hebron,
           and said to the king, Behold the head of Ishbosheth the son of
           Saul thine enemy, which sought thy life; and the LORD hath
           avenged my lord the king this day of Saul, and of his seed.

10:004:009 And David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of
           Rimmon the Beerothite, and said unto them, As the LORD liveth,
           who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity,

10:004:010 When one told me, saying, Behold, Saul is dead, thinking to
           have brought good tidings, I took hold of him, and slew him in
           Ziklag, who thought that I would have given him a reward for
           his tidings:

10:004:011 How much more, when wicked men have slain a righteous person
           in his own house upon his bed? shall I not therefore now
           require his blood of your hand, and take you away from the
           earth?

10:004:012 And David commanded his young men, and they slew them, and cut
           off their hands and their feet, and hanged them up over the
           pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ishbosheth, and
           buried it in the sepulchre of Abner in Hebron.

10:005:001 Then came all the tribes of Israel to David unto Hebron, and
           spake, saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh.

10:005:002 Also in time past, when Saul was king over us, thou wast he
           that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and the LORD said
           to thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be a
           captain over Israel.

10:005:003 So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and
           king David made a league with them in Hebron before the LORD:
           and they anointed David king over Israel.

10:005:004 David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he
           reigned forty years.

10:005:005 In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months:
           and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all
           Israel and Judah.

10:005:006 And the king and his men went to Jerusalem unto the Jebusites,
           the inhabitants of the land: which spake unto David, saying,
           Except thou take away the blind and the lame, thou shalt not
           come in hither: thinking, David cannot come in hither.

10:005:007 Nevertheless David took the strong hold of Zion: the same is
           the city of David.

10:005:008 And David said on that day, Whosoever getteth up to the
           gutter, and smiteth the Jebusites, and the lame and the blind
           that are hated of David's soul, he shall be chief and captain.
           Wherefore they said, The blind and the lame shall not come
           into the house.

10:005:009 So David dwelt in the fort, and called it the city of David.
           And David built round about from Millo and inward.

10:005:010 And David went on, and grew great, and the LORD God of hosts
           was with him.

10:005:011 And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar
           trees, and carpenters, and masons: and they built David an
           house.

10:005:012 And David perceived that the LORD had established him king
           over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for his
           people Israel's sake.

10:005:013 And David took him more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem,
           after he was come from Hebron: and there were yet sons and
           daughters born to David.

10:005:014 And these be the names of those that were born unto him in
           Jerusalem; Shammuah, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon,

10:005:015 Ibhar also, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia,

10:005:016 And Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphalet.

10:005:017 But when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David
           king over Israel, all the Philistines came up to seek David;
           and David heard of it, and went down to the hold.

10:005:018 The Philistines also came and spread themselves in the valley
           of Rephaim.

10:005:019 And David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up to the
           Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the
           LORD said unto David, Go up: for I will doubtless deliver the
           Philistines into thine hand.

10:005:020 And David came to Baalperazim, and David smote them there, and
           said, The LORD hath broken forth upon mine enemies before me,
           as the breach of waters. Therefore he called the name of that
           place Baalperazim.

10:005:021 And there they left their images, and David and his men burned
           them.

10:005:022 And the Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves
           in the valley of Rephaim.

10:005:023 And when David enquired of the LORD, he said, Thou shalt not
           go up; but fetch a compass behind them, and come upon them
           over against the mulberry trees.

10:005:024 And let it be, when thou hearest the sound of a going in the
           tops of the mulberry trees, that then thou shalt bestir
           thyself: for then shall the LORD go out before thee, to smite
           the host of the Philistines.

10:005:025 And David did so, as the LORD had commanded him; and smote the
           Philistines from Geba until thou come to Gazer.

10:006:001 Again, David gathered together all the chosen men of Israel,
           thirty thousand.

10:006:002 And David arose, and went with all the people that were with
           him from Baale of Judah, to bring up from thence the ark of
           God, whose name is called by the name of the LORD of hosts
           that dwelleth between the cherubims.

10:006:003 And they set the ark of God upon a new cart, and brought it
           out of the house of Abinadab that was in Gibeah: and Uzzah and
           Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drave the new cart.

10:006:004 And they brought it out of the house of Abinadab which was at
           Gibeah, accompanying the ark of God: and Ahio went before the
           ark.

10:006:005 And David and all the house of Israel played before the LORD
           on all manner of instruments made of fir wood, even on harps,
           and on psalteries, and on timbrels, and on cornets, and on
           cymbals.

10:006:006 And when they came to Nachon's threshingfloor, Uzzah put forth
           his hand to the ark of God, and took hold of it; for the oxen
           shook it.

10:006:007 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzzah; and God
           smote him there for his error; and there he died by the ark of
           God.

10:006:008 And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach
           upon Uzzah: and he called the name of the place Perezuzzah to
           this day.

10:006:009 And David was afraid of the LORD that day, and said, How shall
           the ark of the LORD come to me?

10:006:010 So David would not remove the ark of the LORD unto him into
           the city of David: but David carried it aside into the house
           of Obededom the Gittite.

10:006:011 And the ark of the LORD continued in the house of Obededom the
           Gittite three months: and the LORD blessed Obededom, and all
           his household.

10:006:012 And it was told king David, saying, The LORD hath blessed the
           house of Obededom, and all that pertaineth unto him, because
           of the ark of God. So David went and brought up the ark of God
           from the house of Obededom into the city of David with
           gladness.

10:006:013 And it was so, that when they that bare the ark of the LORD
           had gone six paces, he sacrificed oxen and fatlings.

10:006:014 And David danced before the LORD with all his might; and David
           was girded with a linen ephod.

10:006:015 So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the
           LORD with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet.

10:006:016 And as the ark of the LORD came into the city of David, Michal
           Saul's daughter looked through a window, and saw king David
           leaping and dancing before the LORD; and she despised him in
           her heart.

10:006:017 And they brought in the ark of the LORD, and set it in his
           place, in the midst of the tabernacle that David had pitched
           for it: and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings
           before the LORD.

10:006:018 And as soon as David had made an end of offering burnt
           offerings and peace offerings, he blessed the people in the
           name of the LORD of hosts.

10:006:019 And he dealt among all the people, even among the whole
           multitude of Israel, as well to the women as men, to every one
           a cake of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon of
           wine. So all the people departed every one to his house.

10:006:020 Then David returned to bless his household. And Michal the
           daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, How
           glorious was the king of Israel to day, who uncovered himself
           to day in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of
           the vain fellows shamelessly uncovereth himself!

10:006:021 And David said unto Michal, It was before the LORD, which
           chose me before thy father, and before all his house, to
           appoint me ruler over the people of the LORD, over Israel:
           therefore will I play before the LORD.

10:006:022 And I will yet be more vile than thus, and will be base in
           mine own sight: and of the maidservants which thou hast spoken
           of, of them shall I be had in honour.

10:006:023 Therefore Michal the daughter of Saul had no child unto the
           day of her death.

10:007:001 And it came to pass, when the king sat in his house, and the
           LORD had given him rest round about from all his enemies;

10:007:002 That the king said unto Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell
           in an house of cedar, but the ark of God dwelleth within
           curtains.

10:007:003 And Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that is in thine
           heart; for the LORD is with thee.

10:007:004 And it came to pass that night, that the word of the LORD came
           unto Nathan, saying,

10:007:005 Go and tell my servant David, Thus saith the LORD, Shalt thou
           build me an house for me to dwell in?

10:007:006 Whereas I have not dwelt in any house since the time that I
           brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt, even to this
           day, but have walked in a tent and in a tabernacle.

10:007:007 In all the places wherein I have walked with all the children
           of Israel spake I a word with any of the tribes of Israel,
           whom I commanded to feed my people Israel, saying, Why build
           ye not me an house of cedar?

10:007:008 Now therefore so shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus
           saith the LORD of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, from
           following the sheep, to be ruler over my people, over Israel:

10:007:009 And I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and have cut
           off all thine enemies out of thy sight, and have made thee a
           great name, like unto the name of the great men that are in
           the earth.

10:007:010 Moreover I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will
           plant them, that they may dwell in a place of their own, and
           move no more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict
           them any more, as beforetime,

10:007:011 And as since the time that I commanded judges to be over my
           people Israel, and have caused thee to rest from all thine
           enemies. Also the LORD telleth thee that he will make thee an
           house.

10:007:012 And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy
           fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall
           proceed out of thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.

10:007:013 He shall build an house for my name, and I will stablish the
           throne of his kingdom for ever.

10:007:014 I will be his father, and he shall be my son. If he commit
           iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the
           stripes of the children of men:

10:007:015 But my mercy shall not depart away from him, as I took it from
           Saul, whom I put away before thee.

10:007:016 And thine house and thy kingdom shall be established for ever
           before thee: thy throne shall be established for ever.

10:007:017 According to all these words, and according to all this
           vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.

10:007:018 Then went king David in, and sat before the LORD, and he said,
           Who am I, O Lord GOD? and what is my house, that thou hast
           brought me hitherto?

10:007:019 And this was yet a small thing in thy sight, O Lord GOD; but
           thou hast spoken also of thy servant's house for a great while
           to come. And is this the manner of man, O Lord GOD?

10:007:020 And what can David say more unto thee? for thou, Lord GOD,
           knowest thy servant.

10:007:021 For thy word's sake, and according to thine own heart, hast
           thou done all these great things, to make thy servant know
           them.

10:007:022 Wherefore thou art great, O LORD God: for there is none like
           thee, neither is there any God beside thee, according to all
           that we have heard with our ears.

10:007:023 And what one nation in the earth is like thy people, even like
           Israel, whom God went to redeem for a people to himself, and
           to make him a name, and to do for you great things and
           terrible, for thy land, before thy people, which thou
           redeemedst to thee from Egypt, from the nations and their
           gods?

10:007:024 For thou hast confirmed to thyself thy people Israel to be a
           people unto thee for ever: and thou, LORD, art become their
           God.

10:007:025 And now, O LORD God, the word that thou hast spoken concerning
           thy servant, and concerning his house, establish it for ever,
           and do as thou hast said.

10:007:026 And let thy name be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of
           hosts is the God over Israel: and let the house of thy servant
           David be established before thee.

10:007:027 For thou, O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, hast revealed to thy
           servant, saying, I will build thee an house: therefore hath
           thy servant found in his heart to pray this prayer unto thee.

10:007:028 And now, O Lord GOD, thou art that God, and thy words be true,
           and thou hast promised this goodness unto thy servant:

10:007:029 Therefore now let it please thee to bless the house of thy
           servant, that it may continue for ever before thee: for thou,
           O Lord GOD, hast spoken it: and with thy blessing let the
           house of thy servant be blessed for ever.

10:008:001 And after this it came to pass that David smote the
           Philistines, and subdued them: and David took Methegammah out
           of the hand of the Philistines.

10:008:002 And he smote Moab, and measured them with a line, casting them
           down to the ground; even with two lines measured he to put to
           death, and with one full line to keep alive. And so the
           Moabites became David's servants, and brought gifts.

10:008:003 David smote also Hadadezer, the son of Rehob, king of Zobah,
           as he went to recover his border at the river Euphrates.

10:008:004 And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven hundred
           horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: and David houghed all
           the chariot horses, but reserved of them for an hundred
           chariots.

10:008:005 And when the Syrians of Damascus came to succour Hadadezer
           king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty
           thousand men.

10:008:006 Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus: and the Syrians
           became servants to David, and brought gifts. And the LORD
           preserved David whithersoever he went.

10:008:007 And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants
           of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.

10:008:008 And from Betah, and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, king
           David took exceeding much brass.

10:008:009 When Toi king of Hamath heard that David had smitten all the
           host of Hadadezer,

10:008:010 Then Toi sent Joram his son unto king David, to salute him,
           and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer, and
           smitten him: for Hadadezer had wars with Toi. And Joram
           brought with him vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and
           vessels of brass:

10:008:011 Which also king David did dedicate unto the LORD, with the
           silver and gold that he had dedicated of all nations which he
           subdued;

10:008:012 Of Syria, and of Moab, and of the children of Ammon, and of
           the Philistines, and of Amalek, and of the spoil of Hadadezer,
           son of Rehob, king of Zobah.

10:008:013 And David gat him a name when he returned from smiting of the
           Syrians in the valley of salt, being eighteen thousand men.

10:008:014 And he put garrisons in Edom; throughout all Edom put he
           garrisons, and all they of Edom became David's servants. And
           the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went.

10:008:015 And David reigned over all Israel; and David executed judgment
           and justice unto all his people.

10:008:016 And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat
           the son of Ahilud was recorder;

10:008:017 And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech the son of
           Abiathar, were the priests; and Seraiah was the scribe;

10:008:018 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over both the Cherethites
           and the Pelethites; and David's sons were chief rulers.

10:009:001 And David said, Is there yet any that is left of the house of
           Saul, that I may shew him kindness for Jonathan's sake?

10:009:002 And there was of the house of Saul a servant whose name was
           Ziba. And when they had called him unto David, the king said
           unto him, Art thou Ziba? And he said, Thy servant is he.

10:009:003 And the king said, Is there not yet any of the house of Saul,
           that I may shew the kindness of God unto him? And Ziba said
           unto the king, Jonathan hath yet a son, which is lame on his
           feet.

10:009:004 And the king said unto him, Where is he? And Ziba said unto
           the king, Behold, he is in the house of Machir, the son of
           Ammiel, in Lodebar.

10:009:005 Then king David sent, and fetched him out of the house of
           Machir, the son of Ammiel, from Lodebar.

10:009:006 Now when Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul,
           was come unto David, he fell on his face, and did reverence.
           And David said, Mephibosheth. And he answered, Behold thy
           servant!

10:009:007 And David said unto him, Fear not: for I will surely shew thee
           kindness for Jonathan thy father's sake, and will restore thee
           all the land of Saul thy father; and thou shalt eat bread at
           my table continually.

10:009:008 And he bowed himself, and said, What is thy servant, that thou
           shouldest look upon such a dead dog as I am?

10:009:009 Then the king called to Ziba, Saul's servant, and said unto
           him, I have given unto thy master's son all that pertained to
           Saul and to all his house.

10:009:010 Thou therefore, and thy sons, and thy servants, shall till the
           land for him, and thou shalt bring in the fruits, that thy
           master's son may have food to eat: but Mephibosheth thy
           master's son shall eat bread alway at my table. Now Ziba had
           fifteen sons and twenty servants.

10:009:011 Then said Ziba unto the king, According to all that my lord
           the king hath commanded his servant, so shall thy servant do.
           As for Mephibosheth, said the king, he shall eat at my table,
           as one of the king's sons.

10:009:012 And Mephibosheth had a young son, whose name was Micha. And
           all that dwelt in the house of Ziba were servants unto
           Mephibosheth.

10:009:013 So Mephibosheth dwelt in Jerusalem: for he did eat continually
           at the king's table; and was lame on both his feet.

10:010:001 And it came to pass after this, that the king of the children
           of Ammon died, and Hanun his son reigned in his stead.

10:010:002 Then said David, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of
           Nahash, as his father shewed kindness unto me. And David sent
           to comfort him by the hand of his servants for his father. And
           David's servants came into the land of the children of Ammon.

10:010:003 And the princes of the children of Ammon said unto Hanun their
           lord, Thinkest thou that David doth honour thy father, that he
           hath sent comforters unto thee? hath not David rather sent his
           servants unto thee, to search the city, and to spy it out, and
           to overthrow it?

10:010:004 Wherefore Hanun took David's servants, and shaved off the one
           half of their beards, and cut off their garments in the
           middle, even to their buttocks, and sent them away.

10:010:005 When they told it unto David, he sent to meet them, because
           the men were greatly ashamed: and the king said, Tarry at
           Jericho until your beards be grown, and then return.

10:010:006 And when the children of Ammon saw that they stank before
           David, the children of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of
           Bethrehob and the Syrians of Zoba, twenty thousand footmen,
           and of king Maacah a thousand men, and of Ishtob twelve
           thousand men.

10:010:007 And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of
           the mighty men.

10:010:008 And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in
           array at the entering in of the gate: and the Syrians of Zoba,
           and of Rehob, and Ishtob, and Maacah, were by themselves in
           the field.

10:010:009 When Joab saw that the front of the battle was against him
           before and behind, he chose of all the choice men of Israel,
           and put them in array against the Syrians:

10:010:010 And the rest of the people he delivered into the hand of
           Abishai his brother, that he might put them in array against
           the children of Ammon.

10:010:011 And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou
           shalt help me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for
           thee, then I will come and help thee.

10:010:012 Be of good courage, and let us play the men for our people,
           and for the cities of our God: and the LORD do that which
           seemeth him good.

10:010:013 And Joab drew nigh, and the people that were with him, unto
           the battle against the Syrians: and they fled before him.

10:010:014 And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled,
           then fled they also before Abishai, and entered into the city.
           So Joab returned from the children of Ammon, and came to
           Jerusalem.

10:010:015 And when the Syrians saw that they were smitten before Israel,
           they gathered themselves together.

10:010:016 And Hadarezer sent, and brought out the Syrians that were
           beyond the river: and they came to Helam; and Shobach the
           captain of the host of Hadarezer went before them.

10:010:017 And when it was told David, he gathered all Israel together,
           and passed over Jordan, and came to Helam. And the Syrians set
           themselves in array against David, and fought with him.

10:010:018 And the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew the men of
           seven hundred chariots of the Syrians, and forty thousand
           horsemen, and smote Shobach the captain of their host, who
           died there.

10:010:019 And when all the kings that were servants to Hadarezer saw
           that they were smitten before Israel, they made peace with
           Israel, and served them. So the Syrians feared to help the
           children of Ammon any more.

10:011:001 And it came to pass, after the year was expired, at the time
           when kings go forth to battle, that David sent Joab, and his
           servants with him, and all Israel; and they destroyed the
           children of Ammon, and besieged Rabbah. But David tarried
           still at Jerusalem.

10:011:002 And it came to pass in an eveningtide, that David arose from
           off his bed, and walked upon the roof of the king's house: and
           from the roof he saw a woman washing herself; and the woman
           was very beautiful to look upon.

10:011:003 And David sent and enquired after the woman. And one said, Is
           not this Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah
           the Hittite?

10:011:004 And David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in unto
           him, and he lay with her; for she was purified from her
           uncleanness: and she returned unto her house.

10:011:005 And the woman conceived, and sent and told David, and said, I
           am with child.

10:011:006 And David sent to Joab, saying, Send me Uriah the Hittite. And
           Joab sent Uriah to David.

10:011:007 And when Uriah was come unto him, David demanded of him how
           Joab did, and how the people did, and how the war prospered.

10:011:008 And David said to Uriah, Go down to thy house, and wash thy
           feet. And Uriah departed out of the king's house, and there
           followed him a mess of meat from the king.

10:011:009 But Uriah slept at the door of the king's house with all the
           servants of his lord, and went not down to his house.

10:011:010 And when they had told David, saying, Uriah went not down unto
           his house, David said unto Uriah, Camest thou not from thy
           journey? why then didst thou not go down unto thine house?

10:011:011 And Uriah said unto David, The ark, and Israel, and Judah,
           abide in tents; and my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord,
           are encamped in the open fields; shall I then go into mine
           house, to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife? as thou
           livest, and as thy soul liveth, I will not do this thing.

10:011:012 And David said to Uriah, Tarry here to day also, and to morrow
           I will let thee depart. So Uriah abode in Jerusalem that day,
           and the morrow.

10:011:013 And when David had called him, he did eat and drink before
           him; and he made him drunk: and at even he went out to lie on
           his bed with the servants of his lord, but went not down to
           his house.

10:011:014 And it came to pass in the morning, that David wrote a letter
           to Joab, and sent it by the hand of Uriah.

10:011:015 And he wrote in the letter, saying, Set ye Uriah in the
           forefront of the hottest battle, and retire ye from him, that
           he may be smitten, and die.

10:011:016 And it came to pass, when Joab observed the city, that he
           assigned Uriah unto a place where he knew that valiant men
           were.

10:011:017 And the men of the city went out, and fought with Joab: and
           there fell some of the people of the servants of David; and
           Uriah the Hittite died also.

10:011:018 Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the
           war;

10:011:019 And charged the messenger, saying, When thou hast made an end
           of telling the matters of the war unto the king,

10:011:020 And if so be that the king's wrath arise, and he say unto
           thee, Wherefore approached ye so nigh unto the city when ye
           did fight? knew ye not that they would shoot from the wall?

10:011:021 Who smote Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? did not a woman
           cast a piece of a millstone upon him from the wall, that he
           died in Thebez? why went ye nigh the wall? then say thou, Thy
           servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.

10:011:022 So the messenger went, and came and shewed David all that Joab
           had sent him for.

10:011:023 And the messenger said unto David, Surely the men prevailed
           against us, and came out unto us into the field, and we were
           upon them even unto the entering of the gate.

10:011:024 And the shooters shot from off the wall upon thy servants; and
           some of the king's servants be dead, and thy servant Uriah the
           Hittite is dead also.

10:011:025 Then David said unto the messenger, Thus shalt thou say unto
           Joab, Let not this thing displease thee, for the sword
           devoureth one as well as another: make thy battle more strong
           against the city, and overthrow it: and encourage thou him.

10:011:026 And when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was
           dead, she mourned for her husband.

10:011:027 And when the mourning was past, David sent and fetched her to
           his house, and she became his wife, and bare him a son. But
           the thing that David had done displeased the LORD.

10:012:001 And the LORD sent Nathan unto David. And he came unto him, and
           said unto him, There were two men in one city; the one rich,
           and the other poor.

10:012:002 The rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds:

10:012:003 But the poor man had nothing, save one little ewe lamb, which
           he had bought and nourished up: and it grew up together with
           him, and with his children; it did eat of his own meat, and
           drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was unto him
           as a daughter.

10:012:004 And there came a traveller unto the rich man, and he spared to
           take of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the
           wayfaring man that was come unto him; but took the poor man's
           lamb, and dressed it for the man that was come to him.

10:012:005 And David's anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he
           said to Nathan, As the LORD liveth, the man that hath done
           this thing shall surely die:

10:012:006 And he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this
           thing, and because he had no pity.

10:012:007 And Nathan said to David, Thou art the man. Thus saith the
           LORD God of Israel, I anointed thee king over Israel, and I
           delivered thee out of the hand of Saul;

10:012:008 And I gave thee thy master's house, and thy master's wives
           into thy bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel and of
           Judah; and if that had been too little, I would moreover have
           given unto thee such and such things.

10:012:009 Wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the LORD, to
           do evil in his sight? thou hast killed Uriah the Hittite with
           the sword, and hast taken his wife to be thy wife, and hast
           slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon.

10:012:010 Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house;
           because thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of
           Uriah the Hittite to be thy wife.

10:012:011 Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will raise up evil against thee
           out of thine own house, and I will take thy wives before thine
           eyes, and give them unto thy neighbour, and he shall lie with
           thy wives in the sight of this sun.

10:012:012 For thou didst it secretly: but I will do this thing before
           all Israel, and before the sun.

10:012:013 And David said unto Nathan, I have sinned against the LORD.
           And Nathan said unto David, The LORD also hath put away thy
           sin; thou shalt not die.

10:012:014 Howbeit, because by this deed thou hast given great occasion
           to the enemies of the LORD to blaspheme, the child also that
           is born unto thee shall surely die.

10:012:015 And Nathan departed unto his house. And the LORD struck the
           child that Uriah's wife bare unto David, and it was very sick.

10:012:016 David therefore besought God for the child; and David fasted,
           and went in, and lay all night upon the earth.

10:012:017 And the elders of his house arose, and went to him, to raise
           him up from the earth: but he would not, neither did he eat
           bread with them.

10:012:018 And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died.
           And the servants of David feared to tell him that the child
           was dead: for they said, Behold, while the child was yet
           alive, we spake unto him, and he would not hearken unto our
           voice: how will he then vex himself, if we tell him that the
           child is dead?

10:012:019 But when David saw that his servants whispered, David
           perceived that the child was dead: therefore David said unto
           his servants, Is the child dead? And they said, He is dead.

10:012:020 Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed
           himself, and changed his apparel, and came into the house of
           the LORD, and worshipped: then he came to his own house; and
           when he required, they set bread before him, and he did eat.

10:012:021 Then said his servants unto him, What thing is this that thou
           hast done? thou didst fast and weep for the child, while it
           was alive; but when the child was dead, thou didst rise and
           eat bread.

10:012:022 And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept:
           for I said, Who can tell whether GOD will be gracious to me,
           that the child may live?

10:012:023 But now he is dead, wherefore should I fast? can I bring him
           back again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me.

10:012:024 And David comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in unto her,
           and lay with her: and she bare a son, and he called his name
           Solomon: and the LORD loved him.

10:012:025 And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he called
           his name Jedidiah, because of the LORD.

10:012:026 And Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and
           took the royal city.

10:012:027 And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought
           against Rabbah, and have taken the city of waters.

10:012:028 Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and
           encamp against the city, and take it: lest I take the city,
           and it be called after my name.

10:012:029 And David gathered all the people together, and went to
           Rabbah, and fought against it, and took it.

10:012:030 And he took their king's crown from off his head, the weight
           whereof was a talent of gold with the precious stones: and it
           was set on David's head. And he brought forth the spoil of the
           city in great abundance.

10:012:031 And he brought forth the people that were therein, and put
           them under saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of
           iron, and made them pass through the brick-kiln: and thus did
           he unto all the cities of the children of Ammon. So David and
           all the people returned unto Jerusalem.

10:013:001 And it came to pass after this, that Absalom the son of David
           had a fair sister, whose name was Tamar; and Amnon the son of
           David loved her.

10:013:002 And Amnon was so vexed, that he fell sick for his sister
           Tamar; for she was a virgin; and Amnon thought it hard for him
           to do anything to her.

10:013:003 But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of
           Shimeah David's brother: and Jonadab was a very subtil man.

10:013:004 And he said unto him, Why art thou, being the king's son, lean
           from day to day? wilt thou not tell me? And Amnon said unto
           him, I love Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister.

10:013:005 And Jonadab said unto him, Lay thee down on thy bed, and make
           thyself sick: and when thy father cometh to see thee, say unto
           him, I pray thee, let my sister Tamar come, and give me meat,
           and dress the meat in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it
           at her hand.

10:013:006 So Amnon lay down, and made himself sick: and when the king
           was come to see him, Amnon said unto the king, I pray thee,
           let Tamar my sister come, and make me a couple of cakes in my
           sight, that I may eat at her hand.

10:013:007 Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to thy brother
           Amnon's house, and dress him meat.

10:013:008 So Tamar went to her brother Amnon's house; and he was laid
           down. And she took flour, and kneaded it, and made cakes in
           his sight, and did bake the cakes.

10:013:009 And she took a pan, and poured them out before him; but he
           refused to eat. And Amnon said, Have out all men from me. And
           they went out every man from him.

10:013:010 And Amnon said unto Tamar, Bring the meat into the chamber,
           that I may eat of thine hand. And Tamar took the cakes which
           she had made, and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her
           brother.

10:013:011 And when she had brought them unto him to eat, he took hold of
           her, and said unto her, Come lie with me, my sister.

10:013:012 And she answered him, Nay, my brother, do not force me; for no
           such thing ought to be done in Israel: do not thou this folly.

10:013:013 And I, whither shall I cause my shame to go? and as for thee,
           thou shalt be as one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, I
           pray thee, speak unto the king; for he will not withhold me
           from thee.

10:013:014 Howbeit he would not hearken unto her voice: but, being
           stronger than she, forced her, and lay with her.

10:013:015 Then Amnon hated her exceedingly; so that the hatred wherewith
           he hated her was greater than the love wherewith he had loved
           her. And Amnon said unto her, Arise, be gone.

10:013:016 And she said unto him, There is no cause: this evil in sending
           me away is greater than the other that thou didst unto me. But
           he would not hearken unto her.

10:013:017 Then he called his servant that ministered unto him, and said,
           Put now this woman out from me, and bolt the door after her.

10:013:018 And she had a garment of divers colours upon her: for with
           such robes were the king's daughters that were virgins
           apparelled. Then his servant brought her out, and bolted the
           door after her.

10:013:019 And Tamar put ashes on her head, and rent her garment of
           divers colours that was on her, and laid her hand on her head,
           and went on crying.

10:013:020 And Absalom her brother said unto her, Hath Amnon thy brother
           been with thee? but hold now thy peace, my sister: he is thy
           brother; regard not this thing. So Tamar remained desolate in
           her brother Absalom's house.

10:013:021 But when king David heard of all these things, he was very
           wroth.

10:013:022 And Absalom spake unto his brother Amnon neither good nor bad:
           for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister
           Tamar.

10:013:023 And it came to pass after two full years, that Absalom had
           sheepshearers in Baalhazor, which is beside Ephraim: and
           Absalom invited all the king's sons.

10:013:024 And Absalom came to the king, and said, Behold now, thy
           servant hath sheepshearers; let the king, I beseech thee, and
           his servants go with thy servant.

10:013:025 And the king said to Absalom, Nay, my son, let us not all now
           go, lest we be chargeable unto thee. And he pressed him:
           howbeit he would not go, but blessed him.

10:013:026 Then said Absalom, If not, I pray thee, let my brother Amnon
           go with us. And the king said unto him, Why should he go with
           thee?

10:013:027 But Absalom pressed him, that he let Amnon and all the king's
           sons go with him.

10:013:028 Now Absalom had commanded his servants, saying, Mark ye now
           when Amnon's heart is merry with wine, and when I say unto
           you, Smite Amnon; then kill him, fear not: have not I
           commanded you? be courageous, and be valiant.

10:013:029 And the servants of Absalom did unto Amnon as Absalom had
           commanded. Then all the king's sons arose, and every man gat
           him up upon his mule, and fled.

10:013:030 And it came to pass, while they were in the way, that tidings
           came to David, saying, Absalom hath slain all the king's sons,
           and there is not one of them left.

10:013:031 Then the king arose, and tare his garments, and lay on the
           earth; and all his servants stood by with their clothes rent.

10:013:032 And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother, answered and
           said, Let not my lord suppose that they have slain all the
           young men the king's sons; for Amnon only is dead: for by the
           appointment of Absalom this hath been determined from the day
           that he forced his sister Tamar.

10:013:033 Now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his
           heart, to think that all the king's sons are dead: for Amnon
           only is dead.

10:013:034 But Absalom fled. And the young man that kept the watch lifted
           up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came much people
           by the way of the hill side behind him.

10:013:035 And Jonadab said unto the king, Behold, the king's sons come:
           as thy servant said, so it is.

10:013:036 And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of
           speaking, that, behold, the king's sons came, and lifted up
           their voice and wept: and the king also and all his servants
           wept very sore.

10:013:037 But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai, the son of Ammihud, king
           of Geshur. And David mourned for his son every day.

10:013:038 So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three
           years.

10:013:039 And the soul of king David longed to go forth unto Absalom:
           for he was comforted concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead.

10:014:001 Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king's heart
           was toward Absalom.

10:014:002 And Joab sent to Tekoah, and fetched thence a wise woman, and
           said unto her, I pray thee, feign thyself to be a mourner, and
           put on now mourning apparel, and anoint not thyself with oil,
           but be as a woman that had a long time mourned for the dead:

10:014:003 And come to the king, and speak on this manner unto him. So
           Joab put the words in her mouth.

10:014:004 And when the woman of Tekoah spake to the king, she fell on
           her face to the ground, and did obeisance, and said, Help, O
           king.

10:014:005 And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she
           answered, I am indeed a widow woman, and mine husband is dead.

10:014:006 And thy handmaid had two sons, and they two strove together in
           the field, and there was none to part them, but the one smote
           the other, and slew him.

10:014:007 And, behold, the whole family is risen against thine handmaid,
           and they said, Deliver him that smote his brother, that we may
           kill him, for the life of his brother whom he slew; and we
           will destroy the heir also: and so they shall quench my coal
           which is left, and shall not leave to my husband neither name
           nor remainder upon the earth.

10:014:008 And the king said unto the woman, Go to thine house, and I
           will give charge concerning thee.

10:014:009 And the woman of Tekoah said unto the king, My lord, O king,
           the iniquity be on me, and on my father's house: and the king
           and his throne be guiltless.

10:014:010 And the king said, Whoever saith ought unto thee, bring him to
           me, and he shall not touch thee any more.

10:014:011 Then said she, I pray thee, let the king remember the LORD thy
           God, that thou wouldest not suffer the revengers of blood to
           destroy any more, lest they destroy my son. And he said, As
           the LORD liveth, there shall not one hair of thy son fall to
           the earth.

10:014:012 Then the woman said, Let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak
           one word unto my lord the king. And he said, Say on.

10:014:013 And the woman said, Wherefore then hast thou thought such a
           thing against the people of God? for the king doth speak this
           thing as one which is faulty, in that the king doth not fetch
           home again his banished.

10:014:014 For we must needs die, and are as water spilt on the ground,
           which cannot be gathered up again; neither doth God respect
           any person: yet doth he devise means, that his banished be not
           expelled from him.

10:014:015 Now therefore that I am come to speak of this thing unto my
           lord the king, it is because the people have made me afraid:
           and thy handmaid said, I will now speak unto the king; it may
           be that the king will perform the request of his handmaid.

10:014:016 For the king will hear, to deliver his handmaid out of the
           hand of the man that would destroy me and my son together out
           of the inheritance of God.

10:014:017 Then thine handmaid said, The word of my lord the king shall
           now be comfortable: for as an angel of God, so is my lord the
           king to discern good and bad: therefore the LORD thy God will
           be with thee.

10:014:018 Then the king answered and said unto the woman, Hide not from
           me, I pray thee, the thing that I shall ask thee. And the
           woman said, Let my lord the king now speak.

10:014:019 And the king said, Is not the hand of Joab with thee in all
           this? And the woman answered and said, As thy soul liveth, my
           lord the king, none can turn to the right hand or to the left
           from ought that my lord the king hath spoken: for thy servant
           Joab, he bade me, and he put all these words in the mouth of
           thine handmaid:

10:014:020 To fetch about this form of speech hath thy servant Joab done
           this thing: and my lord is wise, according to the wisdom of an
           angel of God, to know all things that are in the earth.

10:014:021 And the king said unto Joab, Behold now, I have done this
           thing: go therefore, bring the young man Absalom again.

10:014:022 And Joab fell to the ground on his face, and bowed himself,
           and thanked the king: and Joab said, To day thy servant
           knoweth that I have found grace in thy sight, my lord, O king,
           in that the king hath fulfilled the request of his servant.

10:014:023 So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to
           Jerusalem.

10:014:024 And the king said, Let him turn to his own house, and let him
           not see my face. So Absalom returned to his own house, and saw
           not the king's face.

10:014:025 But in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as
           Absalom for his beauty: from the sole of his foot even to the
           crown of his head there was no blemish in him.

10:014:026 And when he polled his head, (for it was at every year's end
           that he polled it: because the hair was heavy on him,
           therefore he polled it:) he weighed the hair of his head at
           two hundred shekels after the king's weight.

10:014:027 And unto Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter,
           whose name was Tamar: she was a woman of a fair countenance.

10:014:028 So Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem, and saw not the
           king's face.

10:014:029 Therefore Absalom sent for Joab, to have sent him to the king;
           but he would not come to him: and when he sent again the
           second time, he would not come.

10:014:030 Therefore he said unto his servants, See, Joab's field is near
           mine, and he hath barley there; go and set it on fire. And
           Absalom's servants set the field on fire.

10:014:031 Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom unto his house, and said
           unto him, Wherefore have thy servants set my field on fire?

10:014:032 And Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent unto thee, saying,
           Come hither, that I may send thee to the king, to say,
           Wherefore am I come from Geshur? it had been good for me to
           have been there still: now therefore let me see the king's
           face; and if there be any iniquity in me, let him kill me.

10:014:033 So Joab came to the king, and told him: and when he had called
           for Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his
           face to the ground before the king: and the king kissed
           Absalom.

10:015:001 And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him
           chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him.

10:015:002 And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the
           gate: and it was so, that when any man that had a controversy
           came to the king for judgment, then Absalom called unto him,
           and said, Of what city art thou? And he said, Thy servant is
           of one of the tribes of Israel.

10:015:003 And Absalom said unto him, See, thy matters are good and
           right; but there is no man deputed of the king to hear thee.

10:015:004 Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land,
           that every man which hath any suit or cause might come unto
           me, and I would do him justice!

10:015:005 And it was so, that when any man came nigh to him to do him
           obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took him, and kissed
           him.

10:015:006 And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the
           king for judgment: so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of
           Israel.

10:015:007 And it came to pass after forty years, that Absalom said unto
           the king, I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, which I have
           vowed unto the LORD, in Hebron.

10:015:008 For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria,
           saying, If the LORD shall bring me again indeed to Jerusalem,
           then I will serve the LORD.

10:015:009 And the king said unto him, Go in peace. So he arose, and went
           to Hebron.

10:015:010 But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel,
           saying, As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet, then ye
           shall say, Absalom reigneth in Hebron.

10:015:011 And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, that
           were called; and they went in their simplicity, and they knew
           not any thing.

10:015:012 And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's
           counsellor, from his city, even from Giloh, while he offered
           sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong; for the people
           increased continually with Absalom.

10:015:013 And there came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the
           men of Israel are after Absalom.

10:015:014 And David said unto all his servants that were with him at
           Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; for we shall not else
           escape from Absalom: make speed to depart, lest he overtake us
           suddenly, and bring evil upon us, and smite the city with the
           edge of the sword.

10:015:015 And the king's servants said unto the king, Behold, thy
           servants are ready to do whatsoever my lord the king shall
           appoint.

10:015:016 And the king went forth, and all his household after him. And
           the king left ten women, which were concubines, to keep the
           house.

10:015:017 And the king went forth, and all the people after him, and
           tarried in a place that was far off.

10:015:018 And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the
           Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six
           hundred men which came after him from Gath, passed on before
           the king.

10:015:019 Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Wherefore goest thou
           also with us? return to thy place, and abide with the king:
           for thou art a stranger, and also an exile.

10:015:020 Whereas thou camest but yesterday, should I this day make thee
           go up and down with us? seeing I go whither I may, return
           thou, and take back thy brethren: mercy and truth be with
           thee.

10:015:021 And Ittai answered the king, and said, As the LORD liveth, and
           as my lord the king liveth, surely in what place my lord the
           king shall be, whether in death or life, even there also will
           thy servant be.

10:015:022 And David said to Ittai, Go and pass over. And Ittai the
           Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones
           that were with him.

10:015:023 And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people
           passed over: the king also himself passed over the brook
           Kidron, and all the people passed over, toward the way of the
           wilderness.

10:015:024 And lo Zadok also, and all the Levites were with him, bearing
           the ark of the covenant of God: and they set down the ark of
           God; and Abiathar went up, until all the people had done
           passing out of the city.

10:015:025 And the king said unto Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into
           the city: if I shall find favour in the eyes of the LORD, he
           will bring me again, and shew me both it, and his habitation:

10:015:026 But if he thus say, I have no delight in thee; behold, here am
           I, let him do to me as seemeth good unto him.

10:015:027 The king said also unto Zadok the priest, Art not thou a seer?
           return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you,
           Ahimaaz thy son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.

10:015:028 See, I will tarry in the plain of the wilderness, until there
           come word from you to certify me.

10:015:029 Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to
           Jerusalem: and they tarried there.

10:015:030 And David went up by the ascent of mount Olivet, and wept as
           he went up, and had his head covered, and he went barefoot:
           and all the people that was with him covered every man his
           head, and they went up, weeping as they went up.

10:015:031 And one told David, saying, Ahithophel is among the
           conspirators with Absalom. And David said, O LORD, I pray
           thee, turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness.

10:015:032 And it came to pass, that when David was come to the top of
           the mount, where he worshipped God, behold, Hushai the Archite
           came to meet him with his coat rent, and earth upon his head:

10:015:033 Unto whom David said, If thou passest on with me, then thou
           shalt be a burden unto me:

10:015:034 But if thou return to the city, and say unto Absalom, I will
           be thy servant, O king; as I have been thy father's servant
           hitherto, so will I now also be thy servant: then mayest thou
           for me defeat the counsel of Ahithophel.

10:015:035 And hast thou not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the
           priests? therefore it shall be, that what thing soever thou
           shalt hear out of the king's house, thou shalt tell it to
           Zadok and Abiathar the priests.

10:015:036 Behold, they have there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz
           Zadok's son, and Jonathan Abiathar's son; and by them ye shall
           send unto me every thing that ye can hear.

10:015:037 So Hushai David's friend came into the city, and Absalom came
           into Jerusalem.

10:016:001 And when David was a little past the top of the hill, behold,
           Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of
           asses saddled, and upon them two hundred loaves of bread, and
           an hundred bunches of raisins, and an hundred of summer
           fruits, and a bottle of wine.

10:016:002 And the king said unto Ziba, What meanest thou by these? And
           Ziba said, The asses be for the king's household to ride on;
           and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and
           the wine, that such as be faint in the wilderness may drink.

10:016:003 And the king said, And where is thy master's son? And Ziba
           said unto the king, Behold, he abideth at Jerusalem: for he
           said, To day shall the house of Israel restore me the kingdom
           of my father.

10:016:004 Then said the king to Ziba, Behold, thine are all that
           pertained unto Mephibosheth. And Ziba said, I humbly beseech
           thee that I may find grace in thy sight, my lord, O king.

10:016:005 And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, thence came out a
           man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei,
           the son of Gera: he came forth, and cursed still as he came.

10:016:006 And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king
           David: and all the people and all the mighty men were on his
           right hand and on his left.

10:016:007 And thus said Shimei when he cursed, Come out, come out, thou
           bloody man, and thou man of Belial:

10:016:008 The LORD hath returned upon thee all the blood of the house of
           Saul, in whose stead thou hast reigned; and the LORD hath
           delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son: and,
           behold, thou art taken in thy mischief, because thou art a
           bloody man.

10:016:009 Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah unto the king, Why should
           this dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go over, I pray
           thee, and take off his head.

10:016:010 And the king said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of
           Zeruiah? so let him curse, because the LORD hath said unto
           him, Curse David. Who shall then say, Wherefore hast thou done
           so?

10:016:011 And David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold, my
           son, which came forth of my bowels, seeketh my life: how much
           more now may this Benjamite do it? let him alone, and let him
           curse; for the LORD hath bidden him.

10:016:012 It may be that the LORD will look on mine affliction, and that
           the LORD will requite me good for his cursing this day.

10:016:013 And as David and his men went by the way, Shimei went along on
           the hill's side over against him, and cursed as he went, and
           threw stones at him, and cast dust.

10:016:014 And the king, and all the people that were with him, came
           weary, and refreshed themselves there.

10:016:015 And Absalom, and all the people the men of Israel, came to
           Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him.

10:016:016 And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, David's friend,
           was come unto Absalom, that Hushai said unto Absalom, God save
           the king, God save the king.

10:016:017 And Absalom said to Hushai, Is this thy kindness to thy
           friend? why wentest thou not with thy friend?

10:016:018 And Hushai said unto Absalom, Nay; but whom the LORD, and this
           people, and all the men of Israel, choose, his will I be, and
           with him will I abide.

10:016:019 And again, whom should I serve? should I not serve in the
           presence of his son? as I have served in thy father's
           presence, so will I be in thy presence.

10:016:020 Then said Absalom to Ahithophel, Give counsel among you what
           we shall do.

10:016:021 And Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Go in unto thy father's
           concubines, which he hath left to keep the house; and all
           Israel shall hear that thou art abhorred of thy father: then
           shall the hands of all that are with thee be strong.

10:016:022 So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house; and
           Absalom went in unto his father's concubines in the sight of
           all Israel.

10:016:023 And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counselled in those
           days, was as if a man had enquired at the oracle of God: so
           was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with
           Absalom.

10:017:001 Moreover Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Let me now choose out
           twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David
           this night:

10:017:002 And I will come upon him while he is weary and weak handed,
           and will make him afraid: and all the people that are with him
           shall flee; and I will smite the king only:

10:017:003 And I will bring back all the people unto thee: the man whom
           thou seekest is as if all returned: so all the people shall be
           in peace.

10:017:004 And the saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of
           Israel.

10:017:005 Then said Absalom, Call now Hushai the Archite also, and let
           us hear likewise what he saith.

10:017:006 And when Hushai was come to Absalom, Absalom spake unto him,
           saying, Ahithophel hath spoken after this manner: shall we do
           after his saying? if not; speak thou.

10:017:007 And Hushai said unto Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel hath
           given is not good at this time.

10:017:008 For, said Hushai, thou knowest thy father and his men, that
           they be mighty men, and they be chafed in their minds, as a
           bear robbed of her whelps in the field: and thy father is a
           man of war, and will not lodge with the people.

10:017:009 Behold, he is hid now in some pit, or in some other place: and
           it will come to pass, when some of them be overthrown at the
           first, that whosoever heareth it will say, There is a
           slaughter among the people that follow Absalom.

10:017:010 And he also that is valiant, whose heart is as the heart of a
           lion, shall utterly melt: for all Israel knoweth that thy
           father is a mighty man, and they which be with him are valiant
           men.

10:017:011 Therefore I counsel that all Israel be generally gathered unto
           thee, from Dan even to Beersheba, as the sand that is by the
           sea for multitude; and that thou go to battle in thine own
           person.

10:017:012 So shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be
           found, and we will light upon him as the dew falleth on the
           ground: and of him and of all the men that are with him there
           shall not be left so much as one.

10:017:013 Moreover, if he be gotten into a city, then shall all Israel
           bring ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the river,
           until there be not one small stone found there.

10:017:014 And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of
           Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel.
           For the LORD had appointed to defeat the good counsel of
           Ahithophel, to the intent that the LORD might bring evil upon
           Absalom.

10:017:015 Then said Hushai unto Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, Thus
           and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of
           Israel; and thus and thus have I counselled.

10:017:016 Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying, Lodge not
           this night in the plains of the wilderness, but speedily pass
           over; lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people that
           are with him.

10:017:017 Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed by Enrogel; for they might not
           be seen to come into the city: and a wench went and told them;
           and they went and told king David.

10:017:018 Nevertheless a lad saw them, and told Absalom: but they went
           both of them away quickly, and came to a man's house in
           Bahurim, which had a well in his court; whither they went
           down.

10:017:019 And the woman took and spread a covering over the well's
           mouth, and spread ground corn thereon; and the thing was not
           known.

10:017:020 And when Absalom's servants came to the woman to the house,
           they said, Where is Ahimaaz and Jonathan? And the woman said
           unto them, They be gone over the brook of water. And when they
           had sought and could not find them, they returned to
           Jerusalem.

10:017:021 And it came to pass, after they were departed, that they came
           up out of the well, and went and told king David, and said
           unto David, Arise, and pass quickly over the water: for thus
           hath Ahithophel counselled against you.

10:017:022 Then David arose, and all the people that were with him, and
           they passed over Jordan: by the morning light there lacked not
           one of them that was not gone over Jordan.

10:017:023 And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he
           saddled his ass, and arose, and gat him home to his house, to
           his city, and put his household in order, and hanged himself,
           and died, and was buried in the sepulchre of his father.

10:017:024 Then David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom passed over Jordan,
           he and all the men of Israel with him.

10:017:025 And Absalom made Amasa captain of the host instead of Joab:
           which Amasa was a man's son, whose name was Ithra an
           Israelite, that went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash,
           sister to Zeruiah Joab's mother.

10:017:026 So Israel and Absalom pitched in the land of Gilead.

10:017:027 And it came to pass, when David was come to Mahanaim, that
           Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon,
           and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lodebar, and Barzillai the
           Gileadite of Rogelim,

10:017:028 Brought beds, and basons, and earthen vessels, and wheat, and
           barley, and flour, and parched corn, and beans, and lentiles,
           and parched pulse,

10:017:029 And honey, and butter, and sheep, and cheese of kine, for
           David, and for the people that were with him, to eat: for they
           said, The people is hungry, and weary, and thirsty, in the
           wilderness.

10:018:001 And David numbered the people that were with him, and set
           captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds over them.

10:018:002 And David sent forth a third part of the people under the hand
           of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of
           Zeruiah, Joab's brother, and a third part under the hand of
           Ittai the Gittite. And the king said unto the people, I will
           surely go forth with you myself also.

10:018:003 But the people answered, Thou shalt not go forth: for if we
           flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us
           die, will they care for us: but now thou art worth ten
           thousand of us: therefore now it is better that thou succour
           us out of the city.

10:018:004 And the king said unto them, What seemeth you best I will do.
           And the king stood by the gate side, and all the people came
           out by hundreds and by thousands.

10:018:005 And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying,
           Deal gently for my sake with the young man, even with Absalom.
           And all the people heard when the king gave all the captains
           charge concerning Absalom.

10:018:006 So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the
           battle was in the wood of Ephraim;

10:018:007 Where the people of Israel were slain before the servants of
           David, and there was there a great slaughter that day of
           twenty thousand men.

10:018:008 For the battle was there scattered over the face of all the
           country: and the wood devoured more people that day than the
           sword devoured.

10:018:009 And Absalom met the servants of David. And Absalom rode upon a
           mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak,
           and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up
           between the heaven and the earth; and the mule that was under
           him went away.

10:018:010 And a certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I
           saw Absalom hanged in an oak.

10:018:011 And Joab said unto the man that told him, And, behold, thou
           sawest him, and why didst thou not smite him there to the
           ground? and I would have given thee ten shekels of silver, and
           a girdle.

10:018:012 And the man said unto Joab, Though I should receive a thousand
           shekels of silver in mine hand, yet would I not put forth mine
           hand against the king's son: for in our hearing the king
           charged thee and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Beware that none
           touch the young man Absalom.

10:018:013 Otherwise I should have wrought falsehood against mine own
           life: for there is no matter hid from the king, and thou
           thyself wouldest have set thyself against me.

10:018:014 Then said Joab, I may not tarry thus with thee. And he took
           three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of
           Absalom, while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak.

10:018:015 And ten young men that bare Joab's armour compassed about and
           smote Absalom, and slew him.

10:018:016 And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from
           pursuing after Israel: for Joab held back the people.

10:018:017 And they took Absalom, and cast him into a great pit in the
           wood, and laid a very great heap of stones upon him: and all
           Israel fled every one to his tent.

10:018:018 Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for
           himself a pillar, which is in the king's dale: for he said, I
           have no son to keep my name in remembrance: and he called the
           pillar after his own name: and it is called unto this day,
           Absalom's place.

10:018:019 Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, Let me now run, and bear
           the king tidings, how that the LORD hath avenged him of his
           enemies.

10:018:020 And Joab said unto him, Thou shalt not bear tidings this day,
           but thou shalt bear tidings another day: but this day thou
           shalt bear no tidings, because the king's son is dead.

10:018:021 Then said Joab to Cushi, Go tell the king what thou hast seen.
           And Cushi bowed himself unto Joab, and ran.

10:018:022 Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab, But
           howsoever, let me, I pray thee, also run after Cushi. And Joab
           said, Wherefore wilt thou run, my son, seeing that thou hast
           no tidings ready?

10:018:023 But howsoever, said he, let me run. And he said unto him, Run.
           Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain, and overran Cushi.

10:018:024 And David sat between the two gates: and the watchman went up
           to the roof over the gate unto the wall, and lifted up his
           eyes, and looked, and behold a man running alone.

10:018:025 And the watchman cried, and told the king. And the king said,
           If he be alone, there is tidings in his mouth. And he came
           apace, and drew near.

10:018:026 And the watchman saw another man running: and the watchman
           called unto the porter, and said, Behold another man running
           alone. And the king said, He also bringeth tidings.

10:018:027 And the watchman said, Me thinketh the running of the foremost
           is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok. And the king
           said, He is a good man, and cometh with good tidings.

10:018:028 And Ahimaaz called, and said unto the king, All is well. And
           he fell down to the earth upon his face before the king, and
           said, Blessed be the LORD thy God, which hath delivered up the
           men that lifted up their hand against my lord the king.

10:018:029 And the king said, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Ahimaaz
           answered, When Joab sent the king's servant, and me thy
           servant, I saw a great tumult, but I knew not what it was.

10:018:030 And the king said unto him, Turn aside, and stand here. And he
           turned aside, and stood still.

10:018:031 And, behold, Cushi came; and Cushi said, Tidings, my lord the
           king: for the LORD hath avenged thee this day of all them that
           rose up against thee.

10:018:032 And the king said unto Cushi, Is the young man Absalom safe?
           And Cushi answered, The enemies of my lord the king, and all
           that rise against thee to do thee hurt, be as that young man
           is.

10:018:033 And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over
           the gate, and wept: and as he went, thus he said, O my son
           Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! would God I had died for
           thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!

10:019:001 And it was told Joab, Behold, the king weepeth and mourneth
           for Absalom.

10:019:002 And the victory that day was turned into mourning unto all the
           people: for the people heard say that day how the king was
           grieved for his son.

10:019:003 And the people gat them by stealth that day into the city, as
           people being ashamed steal away when they flee in battle.

10:019:004 But the king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud
           voice, O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son!

10:019:005 And Joab came into the house to the king, and said, Thou hast
           shamed this day the faces of all thy servants, which this day
           have saved thy life, and the lives of thy sons and of thy
           daughters, and the lives of thy wives, and the lives of thy
           concubines;

10:019:006 In that thou lovest thine enemies, and hatest thy friends. For
           thou hast declared this day, that thou regardest neither
           princes nor servants: for this day I perceive, that if Absalom
           had lived, and all we had died this day, then it had pleased
           thee well.

10:019:007 Now therefore arise, go forth, and speak comfortably unto thy
           servants: for I swear by the LORD, if thou go not forth, there
           will not tarry one with thee this night: and that will be
           worse unto thee than all the evil that befell thee from thy
           youth until now.

10:019:008 Then the king arose, and sat in the gate. And they told unto
           all the people, saying, Behold, the king doth sit in the gate.
           And all the people came before the king: for Israel had fled
           every man to his tent.

10:019:009 And all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of
           Israel, saying, The king saved us out of the hand of our
           enemies, and he delivered us out of the hand of the
           Philistines; and now he is fled out of the land for Absalom.

10:019:010 And Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle. Now
           therefore why speak ye not a word of bringing the king back?

10:019:011 And king David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests,
           saying, Speak unto the elders of Judah, saying, Why are ye the
           last to bring the king back to his house? seeing the speech of
           all Israel is come to the king, even to his house.

10:019:012 Ye are my brethren, ye are my bones and my flesh: wherefore
           then are ye the last to bring back the king?

10:019:013 And say ye to Amasa, Art thou not of my bone, and of my flesh?
           God do so to me, and more also, if thou be not captain of the
           host before me continually in the room of Joab.

10:019:014 And he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah, even as the
           heart of one man; so that they sent this word unto the king,
           Return thou, and all thy servants.

10:019:015 So the king returned, and came to Jordan. And Judah came to
           Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to conduct the king over
           Jordan.

10:019:016 And Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite, which was of Bahurim,
           hasted and came down with the men of Judah to meet king David.

10:019:017 And there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and Ziba
           the servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his
           twenty servants with him; and they went over Jordan before the
           king.

10:019:018 And there went over a ferry boat to carry over the king's
           household, and to do what he thought good. And Shimei the son
           of Gera fell down before the king, as he was come over Jordan;

10:019:019 And said unto the king, Let not my lord impute iniquity unto
           me, neither do thou remember that which thy servant did
           perversely the day that my lord the king went out of
           Jerusalem, that the king should take it to his heart.

10:019:020 For thy servant doth know that I have sinned: therefore,
           behold, I am come the first this day of all the house of
           Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king.

10:019:021 But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said, Shall not
           Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed the LORD's
           anointed?

10:019:022 And David said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of
           Zeruiah, that ye should this day be adversaries unto me? shall
           there any man be put to death this day in Israel? for do not I
           know that I am this day king over Israel?

10:019:023 Therefore the king said unto Shimei, Thou shalt not die. And
           the king sware unto him.

10:019:024 And Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king,
           and had neither dressed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor
           washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the
           day he came again in peace.

10:019:025 And it came to pass, when he was come to Jerusalem to meet the
           king, that the king said unto him, Wherefore wentest not thou
           with me, Mephibosheth?

10:019:026 And he answered, My lord, O king, my servant deceived me: for
           thy servant said, I will saddle me an ass, that I may ride
           thereon, and go to the king; because thy servant is lame.

10:019:027 And he hath slandered thy servant unto my lord the king; but
           my lord the king is as an angel of God: do therefore what is
           good in thine eyes.

10:019:028 For all of my father's house were but dead men before my lord
           the king: yet didst thou set thy servant among them that did
           eat at thine own table. What right therefore have I yet to cry
           any more unto the king?

10:019:029 And the king said unto him, Why speakest thou any more of thy
           matters? I have said, Thou and Ziba divide the land.

10:019:030 And Mephibosheth said unto the king, Yea, let him take all,
           forasmuch as my lord the king is come again in peace unto his
           own house.

10:019:031 And Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim, and went
           over Jordan with the king, to conduct him over Jordan.

10:019:032 Now Barzillai was a very aged man, even fourscore years old:
           and he had provided the king of sustenance while he lay at
           Mahanaim; for he was a very great man.

10:019:033 And the king said unto Barzillai, Come thou over with me, and
           I will feed thee with me in Jerusalem.

10:019:034 And Barzillai said unto the king, How long have I to live,
           that I should go up with the king unto Jerusalem?

10:019:035 I am this day fourscore years old: and can I discern between
           good and evil? can thy servant taste what I eat or what I
           drink? can I hear any more the voice of singing men and
           singing women? wherefore then should thy servant be yet a
           burden unto my lord the king?

10:019:036 Thy servant will go a little way over Jordan with the king:
           and why should the king recompense it me with such a reward?

10:019:037 Let thy servant, I pray thee, turn back again, that I may die
           in mine own city, and be buried by the grave of my father and
           of my mother. But behold thy servant Chimham; let him go over
           with my lord the king; and do to him what shall seem good unto
           thee.

10:019:038 And the king answered, Chimham shall go over with me, and I
           will do to him that which shall seem good unto thee: and
           whatsoever thou shalt require of me, that will I do for thee.

10:019:039 And all the people went over Jordan. And when the king was
           come over, the king kissed Barzillai, and blessed him; and he
           returned unto his own place.

10:019:040 Then the king went on to Gilgal, and Chimham went on with him:
           and all the people of Judah conducted the king, and also half
           the people of Israel.

10:019:041 And, behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and said
           unto the king, Why have our brethren the men of Judah stolen
           thee away, and have brought the king, and his household, and
           all David's men with him, over Jordan?

10:019:042 And all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, Because
           the king is near of kin to us: wherefore then be ye angry for
           this matter? have we eaten at all of the king's cost? or hath
           he given us any gift?

10:019:043 And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, and said, We
           have ten parts in the king, and we have also more right in
           David than ye: why then did ye despise us, that our advice
           should not be first had in bringing back our king? And the
           words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the
           men of Israel.

10:020:001 And there happened to be there a man of Belial, whose name was
           Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite: and he blew a trumpet,
           and said, We have no part in David, neither have we
           inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to his tents, O
           Israel.

10:020:002 So every man of Israel went up from after David, and followed
           Sheba the son of Bichri: but the men of Judah clave unto their
           king, from Jordan even to Jerusalem.

10:020:003 And David came to his house at Jerusalem; and the king took
           the ten women his concubines, whom he had left to keep the
           house, and put them in ward, and fed them, but went not in
           unto them. So they were shut up unto the day of their death,
           living in widowhood.

10:020:004 Then said the king to Amasa, Assemble me the men of Judah
           within three days, and be thou here present.

10:020:005 So Amasa went to assemble the men of Judah: but he tarried
           longer than the set time which he had appointed him.

10:020:006 And David said to Abishai, Now shall Sheba the son of Bichri
           do us more harm than did Absalom: take thou thy lord's
           servants, and pursue after him, lest he get him fenced cities,
           and escape us.

10:020:007 And there went out after him Joab's men, and the Cherethites,
           and the Pelethites, and all the mighty men: and they went out
           of Jerusalem, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.

10:020:008 When they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa
           went before them. And Joab's garment that he had put on was
           girded unto him, and upon it a girdle with a sword fastened
           upon his loins in the sheath thereof; and as he went forth it
           fell out.

10:020:009 And Joab said to Amasa, Art thou in health, my brother? And
           Joab took Amasa by the beard with the right hand to kiss him.

10:020:010 But Amasa took no heed to the sword that was in Joab's hand:
           so he smote him therewith in the fifth rib, and shed out his
           bowels to the ground, and struck him not again; and he died.
           So Joab and Abishai his brother pursued after Sheba the son of
           Bichri.

10:020:011 And one of Joab's men stood by him, and said, He that
           favoureth Joab, and he that is for David, let him go after
           Joab.

10:020:012 And Amasa wallowed in blood in the midst of the highway. And
           when the man saw that all the people stood still, he removed
           Amasa out of the highway into the field, and cast a cloth upon
           him, when he saw that every one that came by him stood still.

10:020:013 When he was removed out of the highway, all the people went on
           after Joab, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.

10:020:014 And he went through all the tribes of Israel unto Abel, and to
           Bethmaachah, and all the Berites: and they were gathered
           together, and went also after him.

10:020:015 And they came and besieged him in Abel of Bethmaachah, and
           they cast up a bank against the city, and it stood in the
           trench: and all the people that were with Joab battered the
           wall, to throw it down.

10:020:016 Then cried a wise woman out of the city, Hear, hear; say, I
           pray you, unto Joab, Come near hither, that I may speak with
           thee.

10:020:017 And when he was come near unto her, the woman said, Art thou
           Joab? And he answered, I am he. Then she said unto him, Hear
           the words of thine handmaid. And he answered, I do hear.

10:020:018 Then she spake, saying, They were wont to speak in old time,
           saying, They shall surely ask counsel at Abel: and so they
           ended the matter.

10:020:019 I am one of them that are peaceable and faithful in Israel:
           thou seekest to destroy a city and a mother in Israel: why
           wilt thou swallow up the inheritance of the LORD?

10:020:020 And Joab answered and said, Far be it, far be it from me, that
           I should swallow up or destroy.

10:020:021 The matter is not so: but a man of mount Ephraim, Sheba the
           son of Bichri by name, hath lifted up his hand against the
           king, even against David: deliver him only, and I will depart
           from the city. And the woman said unto Joab, Behold, his head
           shall be thrown to thee over the wall.

10:020:022 Then the woman went unto all the people in her wisdom. And
           they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri, and cast it
           out to Joab. And he blew a trumpet, and they retired from the
           city, every man to his tent. And Joab returned to Jerusalem
           unto the king.

10:020:023 Now Joab was over all the host of Israel: and Benaiah the son
           of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites:

10:020:024 And Adoram was over the tribute: and Jehoshaphat the son of
           Ahilud was recorder:

10:020:025 And Sheva was scribe: and Zadok and Abiathar were the priests:

10:020:026 And Ira also the Jairite was a chief ruler about David.

10:021:001 Then there was a famine in the days of David three years, year
           after year; and David enquired of the LORD. And the LORD
           answered, It is for Saul, and for his bloody house, because he
           slew the Gibeonites.

10:021:002 And the king called the Gibeonites, and said unto them; (now
           the Gibeonites were not of the children of Israel, but of the
           remnant of the Amorites; and the children of Israel had sworn
           unto them: and Saul sought to slay them in his zeal to the
           children of Israel and Judah.)

10:021:003 Wherefore David said unto the Gibeonites, What shall I do for
           you? and wherewith shall I make the atonement, that ye may
           bless the inheritance of the LORD?

10:021:004 And the Gibeonites said unto him, We will have no silver nor
           gold of Saul, nor of his house; neither for us shalt thou kill
           any man in Israel. And he said, What ye shall say, that will I
           do for you.

10:021:005 And they answered the king, The man that consumed us, and that
           devised against us that we should be destroyed from remaining
           in any of the coasts of Israel,

10:021:006 Let seven men of his sons be delivered unto us, and we will
           hang them up unto the LORD in Gibeah of Saul, whom the LORD
           did choose. And the king said, I will give them.

10:021:007 But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son
           of Saul, because of the LORD's oath that was between them,
           between David and Jonathan the son of Saul.

10:021:008 But the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah,
           whom she bare unto Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth; and the five
           sons of Michal the daughter of Saul, whom she brought up for
           Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite:

10:021:009 And he delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and
           they hanged them in the hill before the LORD: and they fell
           all seven together, and were put to death in the days of
           harvest, in the first days, in the beginning of barley
           harvest.

10:021:010 And Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth, and spread it
           for her upon the rock, from the beginning of harvest until
           water dropped upon them out of heaven, and suffered neither
           the birds of the air to rest on them by day, nor the beasts of
           the field by night.

10:021:011 And it was told David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the
           concubine of Saul, had done.

10:021:012 And David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of
           Jonathan his son from the men of Jabeshgilead, which had
           stolen them from the street of Bethshan, where the Philistines
           had hanged them, when the Philistines had slain Saul in
           Gilboa:

10:021:013 And he brought up from thence the bones of Saul and the bones
           of Jonathan his son; and they gathered the bones of them that
           were hanged.

10:021:014 And the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son buried they in the
           country of Benjamin in Zelah, in the sepulchre of Kish his
           father: and they performed all that the king commanded. And
           after that God was intreated for the land.

10:021:015 Moreover the Philistines had yet war again with Israel; and
           David went down, and his servants with him, and fought against
           the Philistines: and David waxed faint.

10:021:016 And Ishbibenob, which was of the sons of the giant, the weight
           of whose spear weighed three hundred shekels of brass in
           weight, he being girded with a new sword, thought to have
           slain David.

10:021:017 But Abishai the son of Zeruiah succoured him, and smote the
           Philistine, and killed him. Then the men of David sware unto
           him, saying, Thou shalt go no more out with us to battle, that
           thou quench not the light of Israel.

10:021:018 And it came to pass after this, that there was again a battle
           with the Philistines at Gob: then Sibbechai the Hushathite
           slew Saph, which was of the sons of the giant.

10:021:019 And there was again a battle in Gob with the Philistines,
           where Elhanan the son of Jaareoregim, a Bethlehemite, slew the
           brother of Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was
           like a weaver's beam.

10:021:020 And there was yet a battle in Gath, where was a man of great
           stature, that had on every hand six fingers, and on every foot
           six toes, four and twenty in number; and he also was born to
           the giant.

10:021:021 And when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimeah the
           brother of David slew him.

10:021:022 These four were born to the giant in Gath, and fell by the
           hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.

10:022:001 And David spake unto the LORD the words of this song in the
           day that the LORD had delivered him out of the hand of all his
           enemies, and out of the hand of Saul:

10:022:002 And he said, The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my
           deliverer;

10:022:003 The God of my rock; in him will I trust: he is my shield, and
           the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge, my
           saviour; thou savest me from violence.

10:022:004 I will call on the LORD, who is worthy to be praised: so shall
           I be saved from mine enemies.

10:022:005 When the waves of death compassed me, the floods of ungodly
           men made me afraid;

10:022:006 The sorrows of hell compassed me about; the snares of death
           prevented me;

10:022:007 In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried to my God:
           and he did hear my voice out of his temple, and my cry did
           enter into his ears.

10:022:008 Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations of heaven
           moved and shook, because he was wroth.

10:022:009 There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his
           mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.

10:022:010 He bowed the heavens also, and came down; and darkness was
           under his feet.

10:022:011 And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: and he was seen upon
           the wings of the wind.

10:022:012 And he made darkness pavilions round about him, dark waters,
           and thick clouds of the skies.

10:022:013 Through the brightness before him were coals of fire kindled.

10:022:014 The LORD thundered from heaven, and the most High uttered his
           voice.

10:022:015 And he sent out arrows, and scattered them; lightning, and
           discomfited them.

10:022:016 And the channels of the sea appeared, the foundations of the
           world were discovered, at the rebuking of the LORD, at the
           blast of the breath of his nostrils.

10:022:017 He sent from above, he took me; he drew me out of many waters;

10:022:018 He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them that hated
           me: for they were too strong for me.

10:022:019 They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was
           my stay.

10:022:020 He brought me forth also into a large place: he delivered me,
           because he delighted in me.

10:022:021 The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness: according
           to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.

10:022:022 For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly
           departed from my God.

10:022:023 For all his judgments were before me: and as for his statutes,
           I did not depart from them.

10:022:024 I was also upright before him, and have kept myself from mine
           iniquity.

10:022:025 Therefore the LORD hath recompensed me according to my
           righteousness; according to my cleanness in his eye sight.

10:022:026 With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful, and with
           the upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright.

10:022:027 With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the
           froward thou wilt shew thyself unsavoury.

10:022:028 And the afflicted people thou wilt save: but thine eyes are
           upon the haughty, that thou mayest bring them down.

10:022:029 For thou art my lamp, O LORD: and the LORD will lighten my
           darkness.

10:022:030 For by thee I have run through a troop: by my God have I
           leaped over a wall.

10:022:031 As for God, his way is perfect; the word of the LORD is tried:
           he is a buckler to all them that trust in him.

10:022:032 For who is God, save the LORD? and who is a rock, save our
           God?

10:022:033 God is my strength and power: and he maketh my way perfect.

10:022:034 He maketh my feet like hinds' feet: and setteth me upon my
           high places.

10:022:035 He teacheth my hands to war; so that a bow of steel is broken
           by mine arms.

10:022:036 Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy
           gentleness hath made me great.

10:022:037 Thou hast enlarged my steps under me; so that my feet did not
           slip.

10:022:038 I have pursued mine enemies, and destroyed them; and turned
           not again until I had consumed them.

10:022:039 And I have consumed them, and wounded them, that they could
           not arise: yea, they are fallen under my feet.

10:022:040 For thou hast girded me with strength to battle: them that
           rose up against me hast thou subdued under me.

10:022:041 Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies, that I
           might destroy them that hate me.

10:022:042 They looked, but there was none to save; even unto the LORD,
           but he answered them not.

10:022:043 Then did I beat them as small as the dust of the earth, I did
           stamp them as the mire of the street, and did spread them
           abroad.

10:022:044 Thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people,
           thou hast kept me to be head of the heathen: a people which I
           knew not shall serve me.

10:022:045 Strangers shall submit themselves unto me: as soon as they
           hear, they shall be obedient unto me.

10:022:046 Strangers shall fade away, and they shall be afraid out of
           their close places.

10:022:047 The LORD liveth; and blessed be my rock; and exalted be the
           God of the rock of my salvation.

10:022:048 It is God that avengeth me, and that bringeth down the people
           under me.

10:022:049 And that bringeth me forth from mine enemies: thou also hast
           lifted me up on high above them that rose up against me: thou
           hast delivered me from the violent man.

10:022:050 Therefore I will give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the
           heathen, and I will sing praises unto thy name.

10:022:051 He is the tower of salvation for his king: and sheweth mercy
           to his anointed, unto David, and to his seed for evermore.

10:023:001 Now these be the last words of David. David the son of Jesse
           said, and the man who was raised up on high, the anointed of
           the God of Jacob, and the sweet psalmist of Israel, said,

10:023:002 The Spirit of the LORD spake by me, and his word was in my
           tongue.

10:023:003 The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spake to me, He
           that ruleth over men must be just, ruling in the fear of God.

10:023:004 And he shall be as the light of the morning, when the sun
           riseth, even a morning without clouds; as the tender grass
           springing out of the earth by clear shining after rain.

10:023:005 Although my house be not so with God; yet he hath made with me
           an everlasting covenant, ordered in all things, and sure: for
           this is all my salvation, and all my desire, although he make
           it not to grow.

10:023:006 But the sons of Belial shall be all of them as thorns thrust
           away, because they cannot be taken with hands:

10:023:007 But the man that shall touch them must be fenced with iron and
           the staff of a spear; and they shall be utterly burned with
           fire in the same place.

10:023:008 These be the names of the mighty men whom David had: The
           Tachmonite that sat in the seat, chief among the captains; the
           same was Adino the Eznite: he lift up his spear against eight
           hundred, whom he slew at one time.

10:023:009 And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite, one of
           the three mighty men with David, when they defied the
           Philistines that were there gathered together to battle, and
           the men of Israel were gone away:

10:023:010 He arose, and smote the Philistines until his hand was weary,
           and his hand clave unto the sword: and the LORD wrought a
           great victory that day; and the people returned after him only
           to spoil.

10:023:011 And after him was Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite. And
           the Philistines were gathered together into a troop, where was
           a piece of ground full of lentiles: and the people fled from
           the Philistines.

10:023:012 But he stood in the midst of the ground, and defended it, and
           slew the Philistines: and the LORD wrought a great victory.

10:023:013 And three of the thirty chief went down, and came to David in
           the harvest time unto the cave of Adullam: and the troop of
           the Philistines pitched in the valley of Rephaim.

10:023:014 And David was then in an hold, and the garrison of the
           Philistines was then in Bethlehem.

10:023:015 And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of
           the water of the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate!

10:023:016 And the three mighty men brake through the host of the
           Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that
           was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David:
           nevertheless he would not drink thereof, but poured it out
           unto the LORD.

10:023:017 And he said, Be it far from me, O LORD, that I should do this:
           is not this the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of
           their lives? therefore he would not drink it. These things did
           these three mighty men.

10:023:018 And Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was
           chief among three. And he lifted up his spear against three
           hundred, and slew them, and had the name among three.

10:023:019 Was he not most honourable of three? therefore he was their
           captain: howbeit he attained not unto the first three.

10:023:020 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man, of
           Kabzeel, who had done many acts, he slew two lionlike men of
           Moab: he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit
           in time of snow:

10:023:021 And he slew an Egyptian, a goodly man: and the Egyptian had a
           spear in his hand; but he went down to him with a staff, and
           plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him
           with his own spear.

10:023:022 These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name
           among three mighty men.

10:023:023 He was more honourable than the thirty, but he attained not to
           the first three. And David set him over his guard.

10:023:024 Asahel the brother of Joab was one of the thirty; Elhanan the
           son of Dodo of Bethlehem,

10:023:025 Shammah the Harodite, Elika the Harodite,

10:023:026 Helez the Paltite, Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite,

10:023:027 Abiezer the Anethothite, Mebunnai the Hushathite,

10:023:028 Zalmon the Ahohite, Maharai the Netophathite,

10:023:029 Heleb the son of Baanah, a Netophathite, Ittai the son of
           Ribai out of Gibeah of the children of Benjamin,

10:023:030 Benaiah the Pirathonite, Hiddai of the brooks of Gaash,

10:023:031 Abialbon the Arbathite, Azmaveth the Barhumite,

10:023:032 Eliahba the Shaalbonite, of the sons of Jashen, Jonathan,

10:023:033 Shammah the Hararite, Ahiam the son of Sharar the Hararite,

10:023:034 Eliphelet the son of Ahasbai, the son of the Maachathite,
           Eliam the son of Ahithophel the Gilonite,

10:023:035 Hezrai the Carmelite, Paarai the Arbite,

10:023:036 Igal the son of Nathan of Zobah, Bani the Gadite,

10:023:037 Zelek the Ammonite, Nahari the Beerothite, armourbearer to
           Joab the son of Zeruiah,

10:023:038 Ira an Ithrite, Gareb an Ithrite,

10:023:039 Uriah the Hittite: thirty and seven in all.

10:024:001 And again the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel,
           and he moved David against them to say, Go, number Israel and
           Judah.

10:024:002 For the king said to Joab the captain of the host, which was
           with him, Go now through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan
           even to Beersheba, and number ye the people, that I may know
           the number of the people.

10:024:003 And Joab said unto the king, Now the LORD thy God add unto the
           people, how many soever they be, an hundredfold, and that the
           eyes of my lord the king may see it: but why doth my lord the
           king delight in this thing?

10:024:004 Notwithstanding the king's word prevailed against Joab, and
           against the captains of the host. And Joab and the captains of
           the host went out from the presence of the king, to number the
           people of Israel.

10:024:005 And they passed over Jordan, and pitched in Aroer, on the
           right side of the city that lieth in the midst of the river of
           Gad, and toward Jazer:

10:024:006 Then they came to Gilead, and to the land of Tahtimhodshi; and
           they came to Danjaan, and about to Zidon,

10:024:007 And came to the strong hold of Tyre, and to all the cities of
           the Hivites, and of the Canaanites: and they went out to the
           south of Judah, even to Beersheba.

10:024:008 So when they had gone through all the land, they came to
           Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.

10:024:009 And Joab gave up the sum of the number of the people unto the
           king: and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant
           men that drew the sword; and the men of Judah were five
           hundred thousand men.

10:024:010 And David's heart smote him after that he had numbered the
           people. And David said unto the LORD, I have sinned greatly in
           that I have done: and now, I beseech thee, O LORD, take away
           the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.

10:024:011 For when David was up in the morning, the word of the LORD
           came unto the prophet Gad, David's seer, saying,

10:024:012 Go and say unto David, Thus saith the LORD, I offer thee three
           things; choose thee one of them, that I may do it unto thee.

10:024:013 So Gad came to David, and told him, and said unto him, Shall
           seven years of famine come unto thee in thy land? or wilt thou
           flee three months before thine enemies, while they pursue
           thee? or that there be three days' pestilence in thy land? now
           advise, and see what answer I shall return to him that sent
           me.

10:024:014 And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let us fall
           now into the hand of the LORD; for his mercies are great: and
           let me not fall into the hand of man.

10:024:015 So the LORD sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning
           even to the time appointed: and there died of the people from
           Dan even to Beersheba seventy thousand men.

10:024:016 And when the angel stretched out his hand upon Jerusalem to
           destroy it, the LORD repented him of the evil, and said to the
           angel that destroyed the people, It is enough: stay now thine
           hand. And the angel of the LORD was by the threshingplace of
           Araunah the Jebusite.

10:024:017 And David spake unto the LORD when he saw the angel that smote
           the people, and said, Lo, I have sinned, and I have done
           wickedly: but these sheep, what have they done? let thine
           hand, I pray thee, be against me, and against my father's
           house.

10:024:018 And Gad came that day to David, and said unto him, Go up, rear
           an altar unto the LORD in the threshingfloor of Araunah the
           Jebusite.

10:024:019 And David, according to the saying of Gad, went up as the LORD
           commanded.

10:024:020 And Araunah looked, and saw the king and his servants coming
           on toward him: and Araunah went out, and bowed himself before
           the king on his face upon the ground.

10:024:021 And Araunah said, Wherefore is my lord the king come to his
           servant? And David said, To buy the threshingfloor of thee, to
           build an altar unto the LORD, that the plague may be stayed
           from the people.

10:024:022 And Araunah said unto David, Let my lord the king take and
           offer up what seemeth good unto him: behold, here be oxen for
           burnt sacrifice, and threshing instruments and other
           instruments of the oxen for wood.

10:024:023 All these things did Araunah, as a king, give unto the king.
           And Araunah said unto the king, The LORD thy God accept thee.

10:024:024 And the king said unto Araunah, Nay; but I will surely buy it
           of thee at a price: neither will I offer burnt offerings unto
           the LORD my God of that which doth cost me nothing. So David
           bought the threshingfloor and the oxen for fifty shekels of
           silver.

10:024:025 And David built there an altar unto the LORD, and offered
           burnt offerings and peace offerings. So the LORD was intreated
           for the land, and the plague was stayed from Israel.

Book 11        1 Kings

11:001:001 Now king David was old and stricken in years; and they covered
           him with clothes, but he gat no heat.

11:001:002 Wherefore his servants said unto him, Let there be sought for
           my lord the king a young virgin: and let her stand before the
           king, and let her cherish him, and let her lie in thy bosom,
           that my lord the king may get heat.

11:001:003 So they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the coasts of
           Israel, and found Abishag a Shunammite, and brought her to the
           king.

11:001:004 And the damsel was very fair, and cherished the king, and
           ministered to him: but the king knew her not.

11:001:005 Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, I
           will be king: and he prepared him chariots and horsemen, and
           fifty men to run before him.

11:001:006 And his father had not displeased him at any time in saying,
           Why hast thou done so? and he also was a very goodly man; and
           his mother bare him after Absalom.

11:001:007 And he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with
           Abiathar the priest: and they following Adonijah helped him.

11:001:008 But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and
           Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men
           which belonged to David, were not with Adonijah.

11:001:009 And Adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fat cattle by the stone
           of Zoheleth, which is by Enrogel, and called all his brethren
           the king's sons, and all the men of Judah the king's servants:

11:001:010 But Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and
           Solomon his brother, he called not.

11:001:011 Wherefore Nathan spake unto Bathsheba the mother of Solomon,
           saying, Hast thou not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith
           doth reign, and David our lord knoweth it not?

11:001:012 Now therefore come, let me, I pray thee, give thee counsel,
           that thou mayest save thine own life, and the life of thy son
           Solomon.

11:001:013 Go and get thee in unto king David, and say unto him, Didst
           not thou, my lord, O king, swear unto thine handmaid, saying,
           Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall
           sit upon my throne? why then doth Adonijah reign?

11:001:014 Behold, while thou yet talkest there with the king, I also
           will come in after thee, and confirm thy words.

11:001:015 And Bathsheba went in unto the king into the chamber: and the
           king was very old; and Abishag the Shunammite ministered unto
           the king.

11:001:016 And Bathsheba bowed, and did obeisance unto the king. And the
           king said, What wouldest thou?

11:001:017 And she said unto him, My lord, thou swarest by the LORD thy
           God unto thine handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son
           shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne.

11:001:018 And now, behold, Adonijah reigneth; and now, my lord the king,
           thou knowest it not:

11:001:019 And he hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance,
           and hath called all the sons of the king, and Abiathar the
           priest, and Joab the captain of the host: but Solomon thy
           servant hath he not called.

11:001:020 And thou, my lord, O king, the eyes of all Israel are upon
           thee, that thou shouldest tell them who shall sit on the
           throne of my lord the king after him.

11:001:021 Otherwise it shall come to pass, when my lord the king shall
           sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be
           counted offenders.

11:001:022 And, lo, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the
           prophet also came in.

11:001:023 And they told the king, saying, Behold Nathan the prophet. And
           when he was come in before the king, he bowed himself before
           the king with his face to the ground.

11:001:024 And Nathan said, My lord, O king, hast thou said, Adonijah
           shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne?

11:001:025 For he is gone down this day, and hath slain oxen and fat
           cattle and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the king's
           sons, and the captains of the host, and Abiathar the priest;
           and, behold, they eat and drink before him, and say, God save
           king Adonijah.

11:001:026 But me, even me thy servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah
           the son of Jehoiada, and thy servant Solomon, hath he not
           called.

11:001:027 Is this thing done by my lord the king, and thou hast not
           shewed it unto thy servant, who should sit on the throne of my
           lord the king after him?

11:001:028 Then king David answered and said, Call me Bathsheba. And she
           came into the king's presence, and stood before the king.

11:001:029 And the king sware, and said, As the LORD liveth, that hath
           redeemed my soul out of all distress,

11:001:030 Even as I sware unto thee by the LORD God of Israel, saying,
           Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall
           sit upon my throne in my stead; even so will I certainly do
           this day.

11:001:031 Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth, and did
           reverence to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live
           for ever.

11:001:032 And king David said, Call me Zadok the priest, and Nathan the
           prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. And they came before
           the king.

11:001:033 The king also said unto them, Take with you the servants of
           your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own
           mule, and bring him down to Gihon:

11:001:034 And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him
           there king over Israel: and blow ye with the trumpet, and say,
           God save king Solomon.

11:001:035 Then ye shall come up after him, that he may come and sit upon
           my throne; for he shall be king in my stead: and I have
           appointed him to be ruler over Israel and over Judah.

11:001:036 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said,
           Amen: the LORD God of my lord the king say so too.

11:001:037 As the LORD hath been with my lord the king, even so be he
           with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of
           my lord king David.

11:001:038 So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the
           son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, went
           down, and caused Solomon to ride upon king David's mule, and
           brought him to Gihon.

11:001:039 And Zadok the priest took an horn of oil out of the
           tabernacle, and anointed Solomon. And they blew the trumpet;
           and all the people said, God save king Solomon.

11:001:040 And all the people came up after him, and the people piped
           with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth
           rent with the sound of them.

11:001:041 And Adonijah and all the guests that were with him heard it as
           they had made an end of eating. And when Joab heard the sound
           of the trumpet, he said, Wherefore is this noise of the city
           being in an uproar?

11:001:042 And while he yet spake, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar
           the priest came; and Adonijah said unto him, Come in; for thou
           art a valiant man, and bringest good tidings.

11:001:043 And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, Verily our lord
           king David hath made Solomon king.

11:001:044 And the king hath sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan
           the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the
           Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and they have caused him to
           ride upon the king's mule:

11:001:045 And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him
           king in Gihon: and they are come up from thence rejoicing, so
           that the city rang again. This is the noise that ye have
           heard.

11:001:046 And also Solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom.

11:001:047 And moreover the king's servants came to bless our lord king
           David, saying, God make the name of Solomon better than thy
           name, and make his throne greater than thy throne. And the
           king bowed himself upon the bed.

11:001:048 And also thus said the king, Blessed be the LORD God of
           Israel, which hath given one to sit on my throne this day,
           mine eyes even seeing it.

11:001:049 And all the guests that were with Adonijah were afraid, and
           rose up, and went every man his way.

11:001:050 And Adonijah feared because of Solomon, and arose, and went,
           and caught hold on the horns of the altar.

11:001:051 And it was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah feareth king
           Solomon: for, lo, he hath caught hold on the horns of the
           altar, saying, Let king Solomon swear unto me today that he
           will not slay his servant with the sword.

11:001:052 And Solomon said, If he will shew himself a worthy man, there
           shall not an hair of him fall to the earth: but if wickedness
           shall be found in him, he shall die.

11:001:053 So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the
           altar. And he came and bowed himself to king Solomon: and
           Solomon said unto him, Go to thine house.

11:002:001 Now the days of David drew nigh that he should die; and he
           charged Solomon his son, saying,

11:002:002 I go the way of all the earth: be thou strong therefore, and
           shew thyself a man;

11:002:003 And keep the charge of the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways,
           to keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his judgments,
           and his testimonies, as it is written in the law of Moses,
           that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest, and
           whithersoever thou turnest thyself:

11:002:004 That the LORD may continue his word which he spake concerning
           me, saying, If thy children take heed to their way, to walk
           before me in truth with all their heart and with all their
           soul, there shall not fail thee (said he) a man on the throne
           of Israel.

11:002:005 Moreover thou knowest also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to
           me, and what he did to the two captains of the hosts of
           Israel, unto Abner the son of Ner, and unto Amasa the son of
           Jether, whom he slew, and shed the blood of war in peace, and
           put the blood of war upon his girdle that was about his loins,
           and in his shoes that were on his feet.

11:002:006 Do therefore according to thy wisdom, and let not his hoar
           head go down to the grave in peace.

11:002:007 But shew kindness unto the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite,
           and let them be of those that eat at thy table: for so they
           came to me when I fled because of Absalom thy brother.

11:002:008 And, behold, thou hast with thee Shimei the son of Gera, a
           Benjamite of Bahurim, which cursed me with a grievous curse in
           the day when I went to Mahanaim: but he came down to meet me
           at Jordan, and I sware to him by the LORD, saying, I will not
           put thee to death with the sword.

11:002:009 Now therefore hold him not guiltless: for thou art a wise man,
           and knowest what thou oughtest to do unto him; but his hoar
           head bring thou down to the grave with blood.

11:002:010 So David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of
           David.

11:002:011 And the days that David reigned over Israel were forty years:
           seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years
           reigned he in Jerusalem.

11:002:012 Then sat Solomon upon the throne of David his father; and his
           kingdom was established greatly.

11:002:013 And Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother
           of Solomon. And she said, Comest thou peaceably? And he said,
           Peaceably.

11:002:014 He said moreover, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And she
           said, Say on.

11:002:015 And he said, Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and that
           all Israel set their faces on me, that I should reign: howbeit
           the kingdom is turned about, and is become my brother's: for
           it was his from the LORD.

11:002:016 And now I ask one petition of thee, deny me not. And she said
           unto him, Say on.

11:002:017 And he said, Speak, I pray thee, unto Solomon the king, (for
           he will not say thee nay,) that he give me Abishag the
           Shunammite to wife.

11:002:018 And Bathsheba said, Well; I will speak for thee unto the king.

11:002:019 Bathsheba therefore went unto king Solomon, to speak unto him
           for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed
           himself unto her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a
           seat to be set for the king's mother; and she sat on his right
           hand.

11:002:020 Then she said, I desire one small petition of thee; I pray
           thee, say me not nay. And the king said unto her, Ask on, my
           mother: for I will not say thee nay.

11:002:021 And she said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah
           thy brother to wife.

11:002:022 And king Solomon answered and said unto his mother, And why
           dost thou ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him
           the kingdom also; for he is mine elder brother; even for him,
           and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.

11:002:023 Then king Solomon sware by the LORD, saying, God do so to me,
           and more also, if Adonijah have not spoken this word against
           his own life.

11:002:024 Now therefore, as the LORD liveth, which hath established me,
           and set me on the throne of David my father, and who hath made
           me an house, as he promised, Adonijah shall be put to death
           this day.

11:002:025 And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of
           Jehoiada; and he fell upon him that he died.

11:002:026 And unto Abiathar the priest said the king, Get thee to
           Anathoth, unto thine own fields; for thou art worthy of death:
           but I will not at this time put thee to death, because thou
           barest the ark of the LORD God before David my father, and
           because thou hast been afflicted in all wherein my father was
           afflicted.

11:002:027 So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest unto the
           LORD; that he might fulfil the word of the LORD, which he
           spake concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.

11:002:028 Then tidings came to Joab: for Joab had turned after Adonijah,
           though he turned not after Absalom. And Joab fled unto the
           tabernacle of the LORD, and caught hold on the horns of the
           altar.

11:002:029 And it was told king Solomon that Joab was fled unto the
           tabernacle of the LORD; and, behold, he is by the altar. Then
           Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall
           upon him.

11:002:030 And Benaiah came to the tabernacle of the LORD, and said unto
           him, Thus saith the king, Come forth. And he said, Nay; but I
           will die here. And Benaiah brought the king word again,
           saying, Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me.

11:002:031 And the king said unto him, Do as he hath said, and fall upon
           him, and bury him; that thou mayest take away the innocent
           blood, which Joab shed, from me, and from the house of my
           father.

11:002:032 And the LORD shall return his blood upon his own head, who
           fell upon two men more righteous and better than he, and slew
           them with the sword, my father David not knowing thereof, to
           wit, Abner the son of Ner, captain of the host of Israel, and
           Amasa the son of Jether, captain of the host of Judah.

11:002:033 Their blood shall therefore return upon the head of Joab, and
           upon the head of his seed for ever: but upon David, and upon
           his seed, and upon his house, and upon his throne, shall there
           be peace for ever from the LORD.

11:002:034 So Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fell upon him, and
           slew him: and he was buried in his own house in the
           wilderness.

11:002:035 And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over
           the host: and Zadok the priest did the king put in the room of
           Abiathar.

11:002:036 And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him,
           Build thee an house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and go not
           forth thence any whither.

11:002:037 For it shall be, that on the day thou goest out, and passest
           over the brook Kidron, thou shalt know for certain that thou
           shalt surely die: thy blood shall be upon thine own head.

11:002:038 And Shimei said unto the king, The saying is good: as my lord
           the king hath said, so will thy servant do. And Shimei dwelt
           in Jerusalem many days.

11:002:039 And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the
           servants of Shimei ran away unto Achish son of Maachah king of
           Gath. And they told Shimei, saying, Behold, thy servants be in
           Gath.

11:002:040 And Shimei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Gath to
           Achish to seek his servants: and Shimei went, and brought his
           servants from Gath.

11:002:041 And it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to
           Gath, and was come again.

11:002:042 And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him,
           Did I not make thee to swear by the LORD, and protested unto
           thee, saying, Know for a certain, on the day thou goest out,
           and walkest abroad any whither, that thou shalt surely die?
           and thou saidst unto me, The word that I have heard is good.

11:002:043 Why then hast thou not kept the oath of the LORD, and the
           commandment that I have charged thee with?

11:002:044 The king said moreover to Shimei, Thou knowest all the
           wickedness which thine heart is privy to, that thou didst to
           David my father: therefore the LORD shall return thy
           wickedness upon thine own head;

11:002:045 And king Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David
           shall be established before the LORD for ever.

11:002:046 So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; which went
           out, and fell upon him, that he died. And the kingdom was
           established in the hand of Solomon.

11:003:001 And Solomon made affinity with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and took
           Pharaoh's daughter, and brought her into the city of David,
           until he had made an end of building his own house, and the
           house of the LORD, and the wall of Jerusalem round about.

11:003:002 Only the people sacrificed in high places, because there was
           no house built unto the name of the LORD, until those days.

11:003:003 And Solomon loved the LORD, walking in the statutes of David
           his father: only he sacrificed and burnt incense in high
           places.

11:003:004 And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was
           the great high place: a thousand burnt offerings did Solomon
           offer upon that altar.

11:003:005 In Gibeon the LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream by night:
           and God said, Ask what I shall give thee.

11:003:006 And Solomon said, Thou hast shewed unto thy servant David my
           father great mercy, according as he walked before thee in
           truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with
           thee; and thou hast kept for him this great kindness, that
           thou hast given him a son to sit on his throne, as it is this
           day.

11:003:007 And now, O LORD my God, thou hast made thy servant king
           instead of David my father: and I am but a little child: I
           know not how to go out or come in.

11:003:008 And thy servant is in the midst of thy people which thou hast
           chosen, a great people, that cannot be numbered nor counted
           for multitude.

11:003:009 Give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy
           people, that I may discern between good and bad: for who is
           able to judge this thy so great a people?

11:003:010 And the speech pleased the LORD, that Solomon had asked this
           thing.

11:003:011 And God said unto him, Because thou hast asked this thing, and
           hast not asked for thyself long life; neither hast asked
           riches for thyself, nor hast asked the life of thine enemies;
           but hast asked for thyself understanding to discern judgment;

11:003:012 Behold, I have done according to thy words: lo, I have given
           thee a wise and an understanding heart; so that there was none
           like thee before thee, neither after thee shall any arise like
           unto thee.

11:003:013 And I have also given thee that which thou hast not asked,
           both riches, and honour: so that there shall not be any among
           the kings like unto thee all thy days.

11:003:014 And if thou wilt walk in my ways, to keep my statutes and my
           commandments, as thy father David did walk, then I will
           lengthen thy days.

11:003:015 And Solomon awoke; and, behold, it was a dream. And he came to
           Jerusalem, and stood before the ark of the covenant of the
           LORD, and offered up burnt offerings, and offered peace
           offerings, and made a feast to all his servants.

11:003:016 Then came there two women, that were harlots, unto the king,
           and stood before him.

11:003:017 And the one woman said, O my lord, I and this woman dwell in
           one house; and I was delivered of a child with her in the
           house.

11:003:018 And it came to pass the third day after that I was delivered,
           that this woman was delivered also: and we were together;
           there was no stranger with us in the house, save we two in the
           house.

11:003:019 And this woman's child died in the night; because she overlaid
           it.

11:003:020 And she arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me,
           while thine handmaid slept, and laid it in her bosom, and laid
           her dead child in my bosom.

11:003:021 And when I rose in the morning to give my child suck, behold,
           it was dead: but when I had considered it in the morning,
           behold, it was not my son, which I did bear.

11:003:022 And the other woman said, Nay; but the living is my son, and
           the dead is thy son. And this said, No; but the dead is thy
           son, and the living is my son. Thus they spake before the
           king.

11:003:023 Then said the king, The one saith, This is my son that liveth,
           and thy son is the dead: and the other saith, Nay; but thy son
           is the dead, and my son is the living.

11:003:024 And the king said, Bring me a sword. And they brought a sword
           before the king.

11:003:025 And the king said, Divide the living child in two, and give
           half to the one, and half to the other.

11:003:026 Then spake the woman whose the living child was unto the king,
           for her bowels yearned upon her son, and she said, O my lord,
           give her the living child, and in no wise slay it. But the
           other said, Let it be neither mine nor thine, but divide it.

11:003:027 Then the king answered and said, Give her the living child,
           and in no wise slay it: she is the mother thereof.

11:003:028 And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had
           judged; and they feared the king: for they saw that the wisdom
           of God was in him, to do judgment.

11:004:001 So king Solomon was king over all Israel.

11:004:002 And these were the princes which he had; Azariah the son of
           Zadok the priest,

11:004:003 Elihoreph and Ahiah, the sons of Shisha, scribes; Jehoshaphat
           the son of Ahilud, the recorder.

11:004:004 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the host: and Zadok
           and Abiathar were the priests:

11:004:005 And Azariah the son of Nathan was over the officers: and Zabud
           the son of Nathan was principal officer, and the king's
           friend:

11:004:006 And Ahishar was over the household: and Adoniram the son of
           Abda was over the tribute.

11:004:007 And Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel, which
           provided victuals for the king and his household: each man his
           month in a year made provision.

11:004:008 And these are their names: The son of Hur, in mount Ephraim:

11:004:009 The son of Dekar, in Makaz, and in Shaalbim, and Bethshemesh,
           and Elonbethhanan:

11:004:010 The son of Hesed, in Aruboth; to him pertained Sochoh, and all
           the land of Hepher:

11:004:011 The son of Abinadab, in all the region of Dor; which had
           Taphath the daughter of Solomon to wife:

11:004:012 Baana the son of Ahilud; to him pertained Taanach and Megiddo,
           and all Bethshean, which is by Zartanah beneath Jezreel, from
           Bethshean to Abelmeholah, even unto the place that is beyond
           Jokneam:

11:004:013 The son of Geber, in Ramothgilead; to him pertained the towns
           of Jair the son of Manasseh, which are in Gilead; to him also
           pertained the region of Argob, which is in Bashan, threescore
           great cities with walls and brasen bars:

11:004:014 Ahinadab the son of Iddo had Mahanaim:

11:004:015 Ahimaaz was in Naphtali; he also took Basmath the daughter of
           Solomon to wife:

11:004:016 Baanah the son of Hushai was in Asher and in Aloth:

11:004:017 Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah, in Issachar:

11:004:018 Shimei the son of Elah, in Benjamin:

11:004:019 Geber the son of Uri was in the country of Gilead, in the
           country of Sihon king of the Amorites, and of Og king of
           Bashan; and he was the only officer which was in the land.

11:004:020 Judah and Israel were many, as the sand which is by the sea in
           multitude, eating and drinking, and making merry.

11:004:021 And Solomon reigned over all kingdoms from the river unto the
           land of the Philistines, and unto the border of Egypt: they
           brought presents, and served Solomon all the days of his life.

11:004:022 And Solomon's provision for one day was thirty measures of
           fine flour, and threescore measures of meal,

11:004:023 Ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and an
           hundred sheep, beside harts, and roebucks, and fallowdeer, and
           fatted fowl.

11:004:024 For he had dominion over all the region on this side the
           river, from Tiphsah even to Azzah, over all the kings on this
           side the river: and he had peace on all sides round about him.

11:004:025 And Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine
           and under his fig tree, from Dan even to Beersheba, all the
           days of Solomon.

11:004:026 And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his
           chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen.

11:004:027 And those officers provided victual for king Solomon, and for
           all that came unto king Solomon's table, every man in his
           month: they lacked nothing.

11:004:028 Barley also and straw for the horses and dromedaries brought
           they unto the place where the officers were, every man
           according to his charge.

11:004:029 And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much,
           and largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the sea
           shore.

11:004:030 And Solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children
           of the east country, and all the wisdom of Egypt.

11:004:031 For he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and
           Heman, and Chalcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol: and his fame
           was in all nations round about.

11:004:032 And he spake three thousand proverbs: and his songs were a
           thousand and five.

11:004:033 And he spake of trees, from the cedar tree that is in Lebanon
           even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall: he spake
           also of beasts, and of fowl, and of creeping things, and of
           fishes.

11:004:034 And there came of all people to hear the wisdom of Solomon,
           from all kings of the earth, which had heard of his wisdom.

11:005:001 And Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants unto Solomon; for he
           had heard that they had anointed him king in the room of his
           father: for Hiram was ever a lover of David.

11:005:002 And Solomon sent to Hiram, saying,

11:005:003 Thou knowest how that David my father could not build an house
           unto the name of the LORD his God for the wars which were
           about him on every side, until the LORD put them under the
           soles of his feet.

11:005:004 But now the LORD my God hath given me rest on every side, so
           that there is neither adversary nor evil occurrent.

11:005:005 And, behold, I purpose to build an house unto the name of the
           LORD my God, as the LORD spake unto David my father, saying,
           Thy son, whom I will set upon thy throne in thy room, he shall
           build an house unto my name.

11:005:006 Now therefore command thou that they hew me cedar trees out of
           Lebanon; and my servants shall be with thy servants: and unto
           thee will I give hire for thy servants according to all that
           thou shalt appoint: for thou knowest that there is not among
           us any that can skill to hew timber like unto the Sidonians.

11:005:007 And it came to pass, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon,
           that he rejoiced greatly, and said, Blessed be the LORD this
           day, which hath given unto David a wise son over this great
           people.

11:005:008 And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, I have considered the
           things which thou sentest to me for: and I will do all thy
           desire concerning timber of cedar, and concerning timber of
           fir.

11:005:009 My servants shall bring them down from Lebanon unto the sea:
           and I will convey them by sea in floats unto the place that
           thou shalt appoint me, and will cause them to be discharged
           there, and thou shalt receive them: and thou shalt accomplish
           my desire, in giving food for my household.

11:005:010 So Hiram gave Solomon cedar trees and fir trees according to
           all his desire.

11:005:011 And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for
           food to his household, and twenty measures of pure oil: thus
           gave Solomon to Hiram year by year.

11:005:012 And the LORD gave Solomon wisdom, as he promised him: and
           there was peace between Hiram and Solomon; and they two made a
           league together.

11:005:013 And king Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel; and the levy
           was thirty thousand men.

11:005:014 And he sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand a month by courses:
           a month they were in Lebanon, and two months at home: and
           Adoniram was over the levy.

11:005:015 And Solomon had threescore and ten thousand that bare burdens,
           and fourscore thousand hewers in the mountains;

11:005:016 Beside the chief of Solomon's officers which were over the
           work, three thousand and three hundred, which ruled over the
           people that wrought in the work.

11:005:017 And the king commanded, and they brought great stones, costly
           stones, and hewed stones, to lay the foundation of the house.

11:005:018 And Solomon's builders and Hiram's builders did hew them, and
           the stonesquarers: so they prepared timber and stones to build
           the house.

11:006:001 And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year
           after the children of Israel were come out of the land of
           Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel, in
           the month Zif, which is the second month, that he began to
           build the house of the LORD.

11:006:002 And the house which king Solomon built for the LORD, the
           length thereof was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof
           twenty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits.

11:006:003 And the porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits
           was the length thereof, according to the breadth of the house;
           and ten cubits was the breadth thereof before the house.

11:006:004 And for the house he made windows of narrow lights.

11:006:005 And against the wall of the house he built chambers round
           about, against the walls of the house round about, both of the
           temple and of the oracle: and he made chambers round about:

11:006:006 The nethermost chamber was five cubits broad, and the middle
           was six cubits broad, and the third was seven cubits broad:
           for without in the wall of the house he made narrowed rests
           round about, that the beams should not be fastened in the
           walls of the house.

11:006:007 And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone
           made ready before it was brought thither: so that there was
           neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the
           house, while it was in building.

11:006:008 The door for the middle chamber was in the right side of the
           house: and they went up with winding stairs into the middle
           chamber, and out of the middle into the third.

11:006:009 So he built the house, and finished it; and covered the house
           with beams and boards of cedar.

11:006:010 And then he built chambers against all the house, five cubits
           high: and they rested on the house with timber of cedar.

11:006:011 And the word of the LORD came to Solomon, saying,

11:006:012 Concerning this house which thou art in building, if thou wilt
           walk in my statutes, and execute my judgments, and keep all my
           commandments to walk in them; then will I perform my word with
           thee, which I spake unto David thy father:

11:006:013 And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will not
           forsake my people Israel.

11:006:014 So Solomon built the house, and finished it.

11:006:015 And he built the walls of the house within with boards of
           cedar, both the floor of the house, and the walls of the
           ceiling: and he covered them on the inside with wood, and
           covered the floor of the house with planks of fir.

11:006:016 And he built twenty cubits on the sides of the house, both the
           floor and the walls with boards of cedar: he even built them
           for it within, even for the oracle, even for the most holy
           place.

11:006:017 And the house, that is, the temple before it, was forty cubits
           long.

11:006:018 And the cedar of the house within was carved with knops and
           open flowers: all was cedar; there was no stone seen.

11:006:019 And the oracle he prepared in the house within, to set there
           the ark of the covenant of the LORD.

11:006:020 And the oracle in the forepart was twenty cubits in length,
           and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the height
           thereof: and he overlaid it with pure gold; and so covered the
           altar which was of cedar.

11:006:021 So Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold: and he
           made a partition by the chains of gold before the oracle; and
           he overlaid it with gold.

11:006:022 And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until he had
           finished all the house: also the whole altar that was by the
           oracle he overlaid with gold.

11:006:023 And within the oracle he made two cherubims of olive tree,
           each ten cubits high.

11:006:024 And five cubits was the one wing of the cherub, and five
           cubits the other wing of the cherub: from the uttermost part
           of the one wing unto the uttermost part of the other were ten
           cubits.

11:006:025 And the other cherub was ten cubits: both the cherubims were
           of one measure and one size.

11:006:026 The height of the one cherub was ten cubits, and so was it of
           the other cherub.

11:006:027 And he set the cherubims within the inner house: and they
           stretched forth the wings of the cherubims, so that the wing
           of the one touched the one wall, and the wing of the other
           cherub touched the other wall; and their wings touched one
           another in the midst of the house.

11:006:028 And he overlaid the cherubims with gold.

11:006:029 And he carved all the walls of the house round about with
           carved figures of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers,
           within and without.

11:006:030 And the floors of the house he overlaid with gold, within and
           without.

11:006:031 And for the entering of the oracle he made doors of olive
           tree: the lintel and side posts were a fifth part of the wall.

11:006:032 The two doors also were of olive tree; and he carved upon them
           carvings of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, and
           overlaid them with gold, and spread gold upon the cherubims,
           and upon the palm trees.

11:006:033 So also made he for the door of the temple posts of olive
           tree, a fourth part of the wall.

11:006:034 And the two doors were of fir tree: the two leaves of the one
           door were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were
           folding.

11:006:035 And he carved thereon cherubims and palm trees and open
           flowers: and covered them with gold fitted upon the carved
           work.

11:006:036 And he built the inner court with three rows of hewed stone,
           and a row of cedar beams.

11:006:037 In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the LORD
           laid, in the month Zif:

11:006:038 And in the eleventh year, in the month Bul, which is the
           eighth month, was the house finished throughout all the parts
           thereof, and according to all the fashion of it. So was he
           seven years in building it.

11:007:001 But Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he
           finished all his house.
